However, in the past five years, there has been a significant increase in podcast awareness and subsequent adoption due to viral sensations like Serial, Celebrity podcasters and Radio Stations making their content available for on-demand listening. This shift has seen significant podcast audience growth and these audiences have become attractive to brands as the next media frontier. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How can brands/companies use podcasting as a medium to attract new clients?There are fundamentally 3 ways that brands can use podcasts to attract and engage audiences and brands:Ad placement within podcastThis would be like placing a recorded commercial on the radio. However, the difference is that podcasts are less cluttered and are a high-intent form of media which means that there will be a higher recall on brand messaging. Ad units are bought and sold on impressions basis and can take the form of pre-rolls, mid-rolls or post-rolls. This is the most affordable way for a brand to engage with podcasts and reach very specific audiences that form around podcasts.Podcast sponsorshipBrands can associate with the content and the content creator. This may follow the same format as sponsorship of a radio feature, but the difference is that audiences develop deep connections with the favourite podcasts and the podcast hosts. There is trust that is built between podcast listener and the host, and through sponsorship, a brand can leverage that trust and build strong brand equity in that audience.Branded podcast seriesThis is the most exciting space for brands at the moment in the world of audio. A branded podcast series gives the brand an opportunity to share their stories in new and interesting ways that not only add value to audiences. The trick is to find creative angles and meaningful narratives that share your brand story. Brand stories also need to shift from, “What can I tell them about Me?”, to “How can I add value through telling our story?”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/549460-120x120.jpg?2" alt="[Radio &amp; Podcasts] Tessa van Staden: 'Storytelling remains key'" width="120" height="120"> Tessa van Staden: 'Storytelling remains key'CapeTalk station manager, Tessa van Staden elaborates on the impact of the coronavirus/Covid-19 pandemic on radio and the industry as a whole, and why storytelling remains key...By Juanita Pienaar 17 Apr 2020.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How have you personally found brands' interaction with podcasting?
