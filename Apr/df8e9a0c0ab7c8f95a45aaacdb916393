However, over-reassuring does not build confidence. Nowhere in the world do people feel reassured that the Coronavirus is under control. Neeran Naidoo takes stock of communicating in a crisis...By Neeran Naidoo, Issued by Hewers 1 day agoSo, based on online conversations from the past few weeks, I put together this guide on what PR professionals should be pitching right now and how they should be doing it. What you should be pitchingRevisit the digital PR campaigns you had planned and ask yourself the following questions. 1) Can it be re-focused in a meaningful way to be relevant today? If you have a campaign that naturally lends itself to being re-focused to include or tie into Covid-19, then you have yourself a plan. Don’t force relevancy if it doesn’t naturally exist. Not everything can be made into a virtual tour or an online class. Stay critical of how your brand/campaign fits into the current narrative.2) If your PR campaign can’t be explicitly re-focused, is it still somehow relevant today? You don’t have to add data about Covid-19 to your campaign to make it relevant. If your brand is in a unique position to still have a significant use today (e.g. cooking, self-care, reading, etc.), then chances are your story will still be relevant to media and audiences alike today. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/546894-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: bongkarn thanyakij on ." width="120" height="120">It is not business as usual, but it is still doing business!Samantha Hogg, owner and managing director of GinjaNinjaPR writes why communication is critical to business survival during Covid-19...By Samantha Hogg 2 days agoIf your brand has a positive story to share, it will be more in-demand now than ever before. There are many journalists right now looking for ethical, positive stories to add variety to their news coverage. Just be mindful of remaining empathetic with the current situation. 3) Is your PR campaign not at all relevant today? If you can’t pivot, pause. Carrying on with no acknowledgement of what’s happening around us today can do serious long-term damage to your brand. Keep these campaigns on the backburner for now. If you can, spend that extra bit of time that you couldn’t afford a few weeks ago, to strategise thoroughly, based on data from past campaigns. This can put life back into your campaigns and ensure you’re ready for a successful launch at a future timely moment. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/545783-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Credit: visuals on ." width="120" height="120">7 tips for crisis communication during the ultimate crisis: Covid-19Whatever your location or type of business you run, the way in which you communicate during a crisis remains the same. Regine le Roux, founder and managing director of Reputation Matters, shares seven habits of highly successful crisis communicators...By Regine le Roux 26 Mar 2020How you should be pitchingAfter you’ve decided which PR campaigns you will run with, comes the all-important step of approaching the media. Here are 5 key actions that can help you with the process. 1. Personalising - without crossing the line This is not the time for generic press releases. Pay attention to what’s going on. Pay reference to what’s going on locally. Pay reference to what the journalist has been writing about or tweeting about.Highlight exclusivity if you can offer it.That being said, do not call to follow up. Follow up calls are generally not popular amongst the media. Moreso now - during times of stress and anxiety - journalists would not appreciate the extra stress of being bombarded or chased by calls.2. Adding an expert voice A spokesperson who can contribute to a story, will elevate your pitch and make it stand out in media inboxes that are currently full of guides of activities to do indoors, virtual tours, and online classes now being offered. An expert voice can add that sense of authority and security that we are all seeking right now. It adds long term credibility and expertise for your brand too. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/544137-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Messaging in a time of crisis" width="120" height="120">Messaging in a time of crisisNicole Capper, CEO of managing director of Mango-OMC shares some insights from conversations she's had with partners and agency owners around the world about messaging in a time of crisis...By Nicole Capper 20 Mar 20203. Minding your own voice Cheeky pitch emails can guarantee sky-high open rates and land coverage links left and right. On a normal day. Right now, you shouldn’t be using human tragedy as a news hook. Keep your communication empathetic and positive. Highlight areas of social good or social impact. Be extra conscious of not spreading misinformation. Back up your campaigns with data and/or expertise.4. Adapting lifestyle PR tactics - reviews are cancelled but samples are still serving Lifestyle PR is home to some of the industry’s favourite cornerstones - reviews and product samples. However, today’s reality finds us without concrete timelines. So, previews of restaurants or hotels that are opening up at a future date are not the most compelling pitches right now.Samples, however, can still work. First, check with the journalists if they would be open to receiving the samples (this is a highly sensitive and personal decision after all). Make sure you can offer contactless delivery - and highlight that in your pitch. Stay mindful of the product samples you’re sending - try to think of products that can be used in isolation. Pitch products that you know are in stock with reasonable delivery time frames to ensure that you’re adding value to the media and audience alike.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/543409-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty Images." width="120" height="120">Communications in a time of crisisAny crisis calls for strong leadership, delivered with clear, concise communications, explains Sandra Gordon, CEO of Stone Soup PR...By Sandra Gordon 18 Mar 20205. Living for slow livingWith all the uncertainty floating about, the one thing we know for sure is that it’s time to slow down. If your brand can offer insights or offers into slow living (think meditation & yoga, cooking, self-care routines, etc.), you can add value by sharing expertise. Be careful not to boast about how your brand took off during the crisis - you don’t want to come across as profiteering from a tragedy. Finally, don’t be discouraged if your campaigns aren’t landing right now or if you’re not hearing back from the media. Just as me and you are scrambling around trying to figure out how to reshuffle plans and strategies in these unprecedented times - so are journalists. Just remember - crises are temporary, sharing reliable information is our ethical responsibility, and empathy and humanity unite us.
