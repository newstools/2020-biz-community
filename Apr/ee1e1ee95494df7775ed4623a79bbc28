This includes design, scripting, animation and final mixing which can be used for an array of formats such as YouTube and Vimeo videos, animated gifs for social media, online banners, email campaigns, in branch digital signage as well as posters for both online and print.Zaba LeRoto Hlatshwayo, creative director at TQ group and co-owner of Craft Creative Brew House, says that assisting companies in this way will enable them to curb costs on non-essential spending while maintaining vital communications with their stakeholders during this critical time. “We have seen government, business and ordinary South Africans making sacrifices in the interest of overcoming this pandemic and saving our precarious economy. We at TQ Group and Craft Creative Brewhouse have put our heads together to come up with what we see as a patriotic contribution to South Africa over this time,” he says.Elbé Smith, CEO at TQ Group, believes that positive and proactive leadership in times of crisis can build social cohesion where collective efforts can bring about positive outcomes.  “South Africans have been phenomenal in mobilising to protect the most vulnerable in our population through churches, community action networks and the like. It is now up to businesses to assist each other to ensure survival post lockdown,” she says.“Restrictions and limitations have the ability to accelerate innovation, drive new ideas and evoke genius. We encourage all South African businesses to take advantage of this opportunity,” concludes Hlatshwayo.See our work here https://www.tqgroup.agency/ourwork.htmlFor information, contact Brenda De Jager on brenda@tqgroup.co.zabRev('brev-be4da529-43c0-4493-bddd-deb3f4454808', '>a/\<az.oc.puorgqt@adnerb>"az.oc.puorgqt;46#&adnerb:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')About TQ Group and Craft Creative Brew House Craft Creative Brewhouse is a full-service marketing solutions agency specialising in tactical and innovative communication platforms and target-based content production.
