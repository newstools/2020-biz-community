I am one of Richard’s biggest fans and have deep respect for how he has dedicated his life to making driving a similar purpose in making the world a better place for all,” says Adam Byars, joint CEO and partner. G in Culture has become exactly that. We share one mission, one purpose, as #themakeitmeansomethingcompany.“As a three times brain cancer survivor I am no stranger to disruption, chaos, pain, suffering and adversity. My current mantra is ‘How can I help?’"  “What is most needed right now is inspiration, motivation, encouragement and some help with a shift in thinking. If I can enrich lives in the smallest of ways at this time, I am making a difference and my life can mean something. That is a gift and I am grateful for every opportunity," says Wright. “Covid-19 has shifted our culture and augmented the way we operate as an organisation, we have focused our efforts on building our teams mindset, methodology and introducing new tools - to achieve tangible results,” says David Cohen, also joint CEO and partner of Grid. #TheMakeItMeanSomethingCompany #G_In_Culture
