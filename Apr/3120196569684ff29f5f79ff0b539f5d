Adam has been working on a few original music projects - recording musicians from their home studios and next week we record singer Jonathan Roxmouth from a studio in South Korea - because we can! Jazzy the dog has been handling all approvals and seems quite happy in her new position at Howard Audio. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/550039-625x231.jpg?1" alt="Howard Audio - Business as unusual!" width="625" height="231">Paul has been producing radio spots and final mixing numerous TV commercials that were produced remotely too. With some album mixing to boot - it’s fair to say Howard Audio is continuing to work and deliver in these difficult times. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/550041-625x231.jpg" alt="Howard Audio - Business as unusual!" width="625" height="231">Don’t hesitate to contact Belinda if you require any assistance with remote VO bookings and recordings, production or composition. We can deliver just like we were back in studio - we’re just not... yet. Keep safe.Howard Audio.
