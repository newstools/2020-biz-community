But, with financial security uncertain for many, businesses must remember that now is not the time for a hard sell – they must show support for the communities which keep them going, says Lockyer.The pandemic has forced the cancellation and rescheduling of many events over the last few weeks, but we’ve seen Milan, Paris, Shanghai and South Africa experiment with live streaming fashion shows, opening up a normally elite event to millions online and making it accessible to buyers, inspiring people around the globe – without the carbon footprint it once had.And, following the cancellation of UK's Graduate Fashion Week, the organisers released a letter to the ‘Class of 2020’, announcing their continued support for students. They are now running a digital showcase, sharing the work of students every day on their social feeds and encouraging students to join the digital conversation.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/543169-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Luxury brands' 3 best practices for coping with Covid-19" width="120" height="120">Luxury brands' 3 best practices for coping with Covid-19The Covid-19 outbreak is taking a toll on the global luxury industry that is heavily dependent on the spending of Chinese shoppers at home and abroad...By Xiaofeng Wang 17 Mar 2020 Instagram has introduced a 'Stay Home' story feature to encourage its users to stay home but remain socially connected during the pandemic.

Keep people interested in what you do, give advice, increase awareness and build brand advocacy. Create for the greater good."
