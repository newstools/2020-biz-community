This info I hear from colleagues or people on my show.— Thando Thabooty (@Thando_Thabethe) April 7, 2020 Fast foward PM finally sits me down on the following Tuesday to tell me that the show doesn’t exist...plot twist...I then hear that the powers that be were told that I DEMANDED a 20% increase and 6 weeks leave.— Thando Thabooty (@Thando_Thabethe) April 7, 2020 I was offered...wait for it...SUNDAYS 4-7am. I have ploughed many hours into the work that I do, and found this an insult after 11 years on radio. I then proceeded to resign. The current line up at 5FM is not a representation of the diverse country that we live in.— Thando Thabooty (@Thando_Thabethe) April 7, 2020 The truth eventually did come out, I was then offered my original slot back, which I declined, in the fear of being victimized by the very same ppl who wanted me gone to begin with.— Thando Thabooty (@Thando_Thabethe) April 7, 2020 And hope that others will be able to speak up when unfairly labeled and treated ❤️����— Thando Thabooty (@Thando_Thabethe) April 7, 2020 I then decided to take back the slot keeping in mind the impact it would have not just on me but the colleagues on my show who have families to feed. Yet again 5FM decided to stick to their original plan and offered me a slot I was again not able to accept.— Thando Thabooty (@Thando_Thabethe) April 7, 2020 Long story short, I hope to now put this matter to rest & continue with my life. I can only appeal to the top management for the people responsible that being the programme and Station Manager to be held accountable ����- end— Thando Thabooty (@Thando_Thabethe) April 7, 2020 Not long after she tweeted the thread, Twitter responded with messages of support:I tweeted that this will probably happen, the day after you "resigned". Sad that the daytime lineup is more ALL MALE, than it was even 15 years ago!!!— DJ Fresh (Big Dawg) (@DJFreshSA) April 7, 2020 Dear @Thando_Thabethe I love your drive, passion, commitment, but most of all I love how you live your truth. How you are unapologetically you. How you are true to YOU! I cant wait to see what you conquer next!— Sanet Croucamp (@SanetCroucamp) April 7, 2020 Never back down, never be afraid to speak the truth and never apologize for standing up for yourself. You are an inspiration for young women and girls.♥️♥️❤️❤️✊��✊��✊�� pic.twitter.com/r2UNPJEKry— Leboya Mara (@darkconjuring) April 7, 2020 Read more here: Thando Thabethe reveals shocking details of 5FM exit on IOL.
