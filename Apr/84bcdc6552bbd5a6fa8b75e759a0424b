It’s a secondary medium so your life doesn’t have to stand still while you are listening, which is the case with things like Netflix. On the radio, people tune in to their favourite people talking about relatable topics and things relative to them. I think the reason it’s so successful is because of live-read ads – they're directly from your favourite presenter and it’s not flashy-in-your-face advertising. Most people don’t know that radio is advertising. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the impact of the coronavirus/Covid-19 on radio and the industry as a whole?Working for one of the biggest radio stations in Cape Town makes you realise what a huge part you play in people’s lives and the responsibility you have. I think it has forced many stations and shows to rethink their content plans. It can’t just be about day-to-day interactions and news anymore, life has changed and so must radio. Our company made dramatic changes all around our listeners, like changing showtimes, going back to the old radio dramas or even giving a portion of a typically serious show dedicated to reading kids stories. If you want to stay relevant, you have got to evolve. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/551544-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Will Francis on ." width="120" height="120">Surveys reveal the impact of Covid-19 on the radio industryPeople around the world are listening to more radio as social distancing changes behaviour, and South Africa is no different. Surveys conducted by some of the country's biggest commercial radio stations show an increase in listening time...24 Apr 2020.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you think is key for brands to remember when connecting with audiences via audio?It’s a very different way of advertising. You’ve got to create the image of the need without consuming your target's full mind (they are most likely performing other tasks like driving or cooking) while selling the solution very quickly. I also think it’s important to have a catchy jingle or phrase that sticks – that way it’s in the back of someone’s mind and as soon as they are faced with the problem, your brand/solution comes up!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How do you think the 4th industrial revolution will influence jobs in radio?Jobs in the industry are much harder to come by because anyone can basically share anything with a worldwide audience with the click of a button. I think people have become a lot more visually stimulated and thus advertising has shifted to digital platforms and social media marketing to reach more people for much cheaper. I do, however, think people still regard the opinions or suggestions of presenters quite highly. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are some of the trends you see happening in the industry, for 2020 and beyond?It’s quite difficult to tell, as we are in very unpredictable times.I think the pandemic has caused industries all around the world to rethink their core business, and master that. I also think that more and more stations will now move away from faceless radio and do more to make it visually appealing to the next generation of listeners..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}List a few things you think the industry can improve on.Developing young talent. More radio stations should focus on constantly developing each generation of radio. There are too many gaps in the industry because radio loves to hold on to big, reliable names instead of training everyone to become that. The human aspect. Many commercial stations thrive off advertising and forget about the human aspect of radio. Your content and stories should always be the focus – not jumping to whichever client pays next. <img src="https://biz-file.com/b/1308/292880-120x120.jpg?1" alt="Gavin Meiring" width="120" height="120">Where is the next radio talent coming from?Having been in the radio industry for over 25 years, I have always heard concern from people in the industry who ask where tomorrow's talent is coming from.By Gavin Meiring 21 Aug 2013.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about what you do?I love meeting people and bringing the magic of radio to them. Most of my work is out of the studios and in people’s homes, offices and on the streets of Cape Town. I love that I get to help people create memories and content for this larger community and make them feel like a star. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is next for you?
