It is about turning ideas into a success story while learning about yourself in the process, fostering an organic process of writing your story from the inside out, and not from the outside in.Two courses are blended into one as: • Taking an insightful and inspirational journey into what it takes to be a writer, and •  An up-to-date exploration of what it takes to craft a story from inspiration to final draft, examining all the building blocks required to write a story that is ready for producing and publishing.It explores the dramatic or comedic potential of stories and empowers storytellers to write a compelling story that will reflect the uniqueness of their culture, history and experience.Writers will learn how to write and market themselves in a way that is attractive to managers, producers, and studios.For more information, contact course creator Daniel DercksenbRev('brev-3db1cba1-6e00-467f-8952-7acb9df06551', '>a/\<neskcreD leinaD>"az.oc.oidutsgnitirw;46#&leinad:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') directly, and/ or visit the Writing Studio website.
