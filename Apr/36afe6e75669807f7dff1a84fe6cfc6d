While Gauteng is directly hiring medical personnel, the Western Cape is calling on medical professionals to volunteer their skills.Says Paul Byrne, Head of Insights for Saongroup Africa (which owns CareerJunction and Pnet), “Teaming up with each Health department we’re helping them get the word out of available positions so they can be filled faster and get more people in the frontline of fighting the Covid-19 virus. CareerJunction has over three million registered job seekers and sends out over 33 million job alerts every month. This places CareerJunction in a unique position to help Government Health departments disseminate their jobs to a larger audience. It’s our way of helping South Africa’s medical sector deal with the fallout”.For more information, browse the latest jobs by each Health department here:Gauteng Department of Healthhttps://www.careerjunction.co.za/companies/34991/gauteng-department-of-healthWestern Cape Government Healthhttps://www.careerjunction.co.za/companies/34995/western-cape-government-healthIf you are a Healthcare department in another province and would like to participate in this initiative, please contact us at info@careerjunction.co.zabRev('brev-5486e549-42c7-4a02-a92a-d859bf758c45', '>a/\<az.oc.noitcnujreerac@ofni>"az.oc.noitcnujreerac;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
