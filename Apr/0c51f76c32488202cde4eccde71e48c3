Once I had attempted recreating the sound, I realised I had cracked it. I am so happy, it hasn’t sunk in yet! I am definitely going to spoil my wife and am going to use some of the money to help fill up my oxygen tank,” said Secret Sound winner Ezra Fredricks. This is the first time in the history that listeners could listen to the Smile Secret Sound via the Smile 90.4FM app. Going forward, every Wednesday during the lockdown, Smileys will have a greater chance of winning the money – with a chance to play 10 times in one day – every hour from 7am to 6pm.“With all that is happening in the world right now, we are excited to be able to put a smile on someone’s face by giving away R20,000! In a time when things are so uncertain, we will continue to spread the good news, provide good content, be a constant companion and make people smile. And even better – continue to make our listeners winners,” said Smile 90.4FM managing director Lois O’Brien.
