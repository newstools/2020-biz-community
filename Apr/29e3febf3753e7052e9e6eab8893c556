McDonald’s wants to give customers daily home-based activities and experiences for their now abundant free time. Understanding the need to cater to the feelings of boredom and isolation as well as creating positive memories for customers and their families, during this time, the Management Team re-focussed elements of their 2020 strategy. The promptly-developed and innovative, yet very simple, #FeelGoodVibes campaign aims to surprise and delight customers as well as drive continued brand engagement while still achieving the brands original objective of celebrating and thanking customers for 25 years of lovin’. “This is a very powerful campaign, catering to consumers when they need it most while staying in line with McDonald’s iconic brand personality of ‘family value’ and ‘sharing’. We could not think of a more appropriate campaign during a time when family-focussed mental and physical health is critical,” says Preneshen Munian CEO TLC Middle East & Africa.The online, home-based rewards form part of a phased-release that becomes available to customers from 1-16 April 2020, by simply downloading and opening the McDonald’s App. The App then generates a unique code and reveals redemption instructions for access to exciting activities which cover a range of categories including wellness, education and entertainment.
