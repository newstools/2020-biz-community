Traditional media, the champion of accurate, credible reporting, has once again become the go-to platforms for regular updates. This is because, since the dawn of the press, journalists have always been at the forefront of wars and challenging historic events, to record the evolution of history to readers. It is no different when covering this global pandemic, as our trusted stable of editors reveal. “Newspapers have a proud record of publishing in times of crisis, from wars to famines, and this crisis is no different,” explains Rapport editor Waldimar Pelser. “We believe that better outcomes are achieved if the public is equipped with good information so that they can make responsible decisions.” It is in times of uncertainty that credible news sources become even more valuable to the reading public because the cost of inaccurate information can be fatal. At a time when most South Africans are faced with extraordinary circumstances, Media24’s editorial independence has never been more important. Because no one sets our agenda, we can deliver quality, trustworthy, fact-checked journalism every day – even in constrained circumstances.“We were all thrust into a new environment in just a blink of an eye and forced to adapt to new ways of operating with no preparation and no rehearsals. We have provided our audiences with quality, in-depth and up-to-date content and will no doubt continue to do so and get even better as this massive story evolves,” assures Mondli Makhanya, editor-in-chief City Press.Fairness and balanceMedia24’s brands are governed by the South African Press Council’s code of conduct and all the work done is underpinned by journalistic ethics. This means all content is edited and fact-checked, and our editors are the last word in ensuring fairness and balance – while holding the powerful and corrupt to account. “In this heightened state of anxiety during the lockdown, our readers need us even more now to bring them credible and trusted information they can rely on, especially to counter the flood of fake news that regularly circulates on social media platforms,” notes Daily Sun editor Mapula Nkosi. Media24 journalists are on the streets holding both government and civil society accountable. This was evident on the first day of lockdown: it was journalists who reported and showed how the lockdown was affecting all of us. It was journalists who exposed the profiteers and rule breakers – and will continue to do so.“Even though this is a big story for us as journalists, it is much more than that. It is no exaggeration to say other than the wars, genocides and famines; humanity has never experienced such tragedy in the past century. We are living and recording history, but as journalists, we are also in the frontline of fighting this virus. It is more than a story, it is a responsibility,” adds Makhanya.Journalism – across platforms – is again proving that in a time of crisis it is of paramount importance for society to function from a place of knowledge. The onus on responsible brands and marketers is to associate with truth always and to support the brands that disseminate this truth.
