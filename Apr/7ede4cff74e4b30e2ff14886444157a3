The hashtag, #Ramaphosa, has been mentioned just over 11,000 times on social media since the start of April, but the hashtag was used the most after Ramaphosa’s national address on Thursday evening. Other hashtags that emerged from this were #CyrilFridays and #FaceMaskChallenge. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/552285.png" alt="Total media exposure, in numbers, for ‘#cyrilfridays’ (blue), ‘#FaceMaskChallenege’ (green) and ‘#Ramaphosa’ (orange) between 17 April and 28 April 2020" width="565" height="387" rel="">Total media exposure, in numbers, for ‘#cyrilfridays’ (blue), ‘#FaceMaskChallenege’ (green) and ‘#Ramaphosa’ (orange) between 17 April and 28 April 2020click to enlarge While #Ramaphosa mentions on 23 April 2020 showed predominantly negative feelings among online users, as indicated by the data below, this was largely due to the @PresidencyZA Twitter account relaying Ramaphosa’s speech on the impact of the coronavirus in the country, as well as negative reactions from South Africans regarding the cigarette ban being lifted. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/552288.png" alt="Social media sentiment analysis, in numbers, on #Ramaphosa during April 2020" width="565" height="387" rel="">Social media sentiment analysis, in numbers, on #Ramaphosa during April 2020click to enlarge But 23 April 2020 also saw #Ramaphosa received the highest number of positive reactions among social media users in South Africa within the month of April.
