When life gives you lockdown, I say #justcookathomesa!” #justcookathomesa will not only provide inspiration during self-isolation via daily YouTube videos, but it will also connect foodies via the #justcookathomesa Facebook group, where you can share tips, tricks and hacks, make new online friends and connect with other minimalist-savvy home cooks. And don’t forget to follow @justcookathomesa on Instagram for more exclusive content.Filmed in her own kitchen by her patient husband, Marc (no fancy TV crews – this is a lockdown, after all), the first few videos, including Tuna and Olive Pasta, Coconut Dhal and Aloo Gobi, are up on YouTube – with more on the way. So subscribe to the YouTube channel, join the Facebook group and follow Justine on Instagram for easy everyday recipes and inspiration.#justcookathome is a Dentsu Content initiative by John Brown South Africa, part of the Dentsu Aegis Network Group.
