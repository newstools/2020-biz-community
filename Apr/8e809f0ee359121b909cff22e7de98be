As a Webby nominee, MakeReign’s work has been singled out as one of the five best in the world in its category (it’s among the top 10% of all work entered) and is competing for the internet's two most coveted awards: The Webby Award and The Webby People's Voice Award. While The Webby Award is chosen by the academy, The Webby People’s Voice Award is voted on by the public. Both awards are a mark of international distinction for Internet excellence.  “Nominees like MakeReign are setting the standard for innovation and creativity on the internet,” said Claire Graves, executive director of The Webby Awards. “It is an incredible achievement to be selected among the best from the 13,000 entries we received this year.” “This is the Internet’s highest honour and we are immensely proud that our work has been singled out as one of the five best in the world!” said Luke Engel, director at MakeReign. “To say that is insane! We want to elevate South Africa on the international stage when it comes to user experience and interface design and this nomination means we’re getting the recognition the talent based here thoroughly deserves.” He continued: “We also share in these nominations with the amazing team at Pineapple who we have an amazing product, and it’s been a pleasure to share in their journey.” Winners will be announced on Tuesday, 19 May 2020, and honoured in an internet celebration on Tuesday, 19 May 2020.
