Steve Biko died because he saw the horror of our people and hence conceived the Black Conscious Movement – something that inspired me to volunteer and declare the time for us to build empires and stop hating each other.Ever been in a township where you, once again, catch yourself having to explain your blackness to the other party? It is time to stop. Sasolburg is not a small township; it is big enough to build empires and stop spreading negativity. Let's grow up. Let the legacy of Dr Richard Maponya live on amongst us and inspire us to think with a billionaire mentality.Don’t stay small, it is time to grow big. Stop analysing things and taking things personally. Business organisations are not united and it is time to change that - We need unity to grow.About Sounds DivineOur services include broadcasting solutions and monetising content.
