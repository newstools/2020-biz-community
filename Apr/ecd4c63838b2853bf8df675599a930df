Covid-19 is going to forever (and has already) change the way humans do business; it has expediated the onset of the digital revolution, our expectations of the quality of online content and people’s expectations of how their favourite brands communicate with them. Consumers now have a taste of the power of online – many who had not yet been “converted”, now have been “forced” to go online, have learnt how to shop online - and it will forever change the way they shop, and of their expectations of brands and businesses going forward.Business owners need to change the way they view, and value, marketing, how they communicate with their ideal customer and understand that the world has now changed forever and that their previous methods of “marketing” are no longer going to ensure a business post-Covid-19. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/546724.png" alt="How SA consumer behaviour is changing in the Covid-19 world" width="120" height="120">How SA consumer behaviour is changing in the Covid-19 worldIt seems like the script for an apocalyptic movie, but none of us will even be venturing into cinemas - until much later in 2020, at least - as much of the world as we know it is in lockdown.

Content is truly kingStrategically communicated content whether it be on your (updated) website, in newsletters or e-mailers, on social media, in blogs or as part of your Google Adwords campaign, are effective and necessary tools for influencing your potential customers’ buying habits in 2020. Well-constructed online marketing is like word of mouth on steroids, yet good quality content is a major shortfall for many businesses on social media and online in general. It is something that needs to be done well; poorly crafted content is not only wasting your (reluctantly-spent-on-marketing) money, it is actually turning your customer off your brand.There is no laterWaiting for the lockdown to be over (and who can guarantee it will be only three weeks?) is too late to start talking to your customers again. They need to hear from you now; uncertain times call for reassurance while in isolation from their favourite brands, they need to know you care, are preparing for them and will be there for them with what they need when the horror of this is over. Seize the day, grab the opportunity and use everything at your disposal to set a future for your business. Or be left behind.
