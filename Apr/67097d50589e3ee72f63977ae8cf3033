The One Club will also post a series of exclusive live Instagram Stories conversations between ADC 99th jury members and creatives responsible for some of this year’s biggest winners to discuss their creative inspirations and processes.Young Ones Student AwardsRecognition of the best creative work by students worldwide will also transform this year, as the Young Ones Student Awards changes from an annual in-person event to a streaming program during Creative Month on May 13 to announce winners and provide other educational content. The One Show 2020After the conclusion of Creative Month, The One Show 2020 will take centre stage as this year’s leading global awards program in advertising and design with special streaming events set for mid-June. Details will be announced shortly.In early March, The One Club announced the switch from in-person to online judging for The One Show 2020 and ADC 99th Annual Awards. The change allowed jury members from around the world to continue to review entries in safe environments and enabled both awards shows to maintain the global integrity and quality of their judging processes. Unlike other awards shows that generate most of their revenue from an in-person festival, The One Club is a non-profit organization that produces more than 80 events around the world throughout the year and is not financially dependent on a single annual awards festival. In-person judging, Creative Week and The One Show, ADC Annual Awards and Young Ones Student Awards ceremonies in New York will resume in 2021.
