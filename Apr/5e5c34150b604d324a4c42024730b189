“We’ve had a great response to hit international horrors like Hereditary, IT: Chapter One and Pet Sematary on Showmax, so we’re excited to see how South African audiences respond when the frights are closer to home,” says Candice Fangueiro, head of content at Multichoice’s Connected Video, which houses Showmax and DStv Now. Rage: when your friends book the wrong house in the wrong town for Matric RageIn Rage, a group of school-leavers descend on a tiny coastal town for a celebration of their freedom. Roxy, Sihle, Kyle, Leon, Tamsyn and Neo party on the beach and drink themselves silly every night. The townsfolk, Hermien and her son Albert, are welcoming – maybe too welcoming. During a psychedelic trip on the beach, the friends witness a disturbing birth ritual, which could be a hallucination, or not. Soon fertility figurines start to appear at random places, and what is supposed to be the best holiday of their lives turns to horror as the teenagers are picked off one by one.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/545975-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Showmax unveils first original horror film, 'Rage'" width="120" height="120">Showmax unveils first original horror film, 'Rage'South African streaming service, Showmax, has unveiled its first original horror film, Rage...27 Mar 2020Nicole Fortuin, whose previous film, Flatland, opened the Berlin Panorama, stars as Tamsyn, with The Girl From St Agnes’ breakout stars Jane de Wet and Tristan de Beer as Roxy and Kyle; two-time Silwerskerm winner Carel Nel (Dwaalster, Hum, Slaaf) as Albert; Sihle Mnqwazana, who co-wrote and acted in The Fall, a New York Times critic’s choice play, as Neo; Shalima Mkongi (Isithembiso, Nkululeko, Keeping Score) as Sihle; and Fiesta, Kanna and Fleur du Cape nominee David Viviers (Kanarie) as Leon.Rage is directed by Jaco Bouwer, a multi-award-winning theatre director who’s one of three Best Director nominees in the drama series category at the 2020 Saftas, for Dwaalster.

Watch Parable first and only on Showmax: https://www.showmax.com/eng/movie/ksm7t7lb-parableEarly reviews for Rage“Scary as hell… The film has jump scares, intimacy, gore, that sense of claustrophobia, mythos and no means of escape… I haven’t seen anything quite like it on the South African film scene and it was thrilling to watch. The film is also beautifully shot and the cinematography is gorgeous.” – 9Lives“Surprisingly, there’s a bit of a gap in South African cinema about our teenagers – born-frees that grapple with the inequalities of a modern Rainbow Nation while trying to navigate their flourishing hormones. In another vein, local horror is another neglected genre – especially when made for a mainstream audience. Rage, however, brings the two into one… It’s a love letter to the classic horrors and slashers of old, enhanced by the ethereal terror of films like Hereditary, Midsommar and The Purge... The gore, the scares and the horror are well-executed, supported by a strong cast of performers... A cool watch for horror fans if you want to escape the actual horror of real life right now, and visually – with blood and all – it’s quite stunning and brilliantly filmed. Maybe just don’t watch it if you’re in lockdown mode in the middle of nowhere – the imagination can be a treacherous thing.” –  Channel24“Just watched the #Showmax original movie #Rage.
