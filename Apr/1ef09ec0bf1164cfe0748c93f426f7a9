The intent was to help all South Africans stay up to date with announcements and developments, and the results so far are encouraging. Usage of the service has increased 20% since the lockdown began, and peak usage is up 80% compared to pre-crisis peaks. In another step to help families through the lockdown period, MultiChoice has added additional educational content to the free service with the Mindset PoP channel. This channel features educational programming covering the entire General Education and Training (GET) phase, including Early Childhood Development (ECD), as well as a key focus on the Grade 4–9 curriculum. The channel aims to prepare children for when schools reopen. Mindset PoP will deliver live lessons daily, with six fresh hours every day. A website is available for parents to download worksheets and information sheets to work through with expert teachers. Lessons are based on the South African Curriculum Assessment Policy Statements (Caps) and are also aligned to the Cambridge curriculum.Speaking about the free news and educational channels, Niclas Ekdahl, CEO of the Connected Video division of MultiChoice, said: “We’re extremely grateful to all of the channel providers for being so willing to work with us to help all South Africans through this unprecedented lockdown period. Thanks to their support we’re able to keep people informed, keep kids’ educations going, and keep people entertained.”The full list of channels available to non-DStv customers on the DStv Now free service is as follows: 100 - DStv180 - People’s Weather238 - SuperSport Play313 - PBS Kids317 - Mindset PoP320 - Channel O343 - TBN400 - BBC World News401 - CNN402 - Sky News403 - eNCA404 - SABC News405 - Newzroom Afrika405 - AlJazeera414 - Euronews Now417 - africanewsTo sign up for the DStv Now free service, go to http://now.dstv.com
