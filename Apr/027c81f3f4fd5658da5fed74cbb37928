Radio will always be a medium that creates a personal connection and in the current situation, this is one of the things that people need the most. For this reason, radio has the power to still attract a consistent amount of listeners, which is a very attractive element for advertises. The personal connection also creates an element of trust between the listener and the DJ, resulting in product placements being better considered than an influencer on Instagram or Facebook. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the impact of the coronavirus/Covid-19 on radio and the industry as a whole. I believe that there has been quite a positive effect from a listener point of view, people that are craving a physical interaction that isn’t the news, have it at the turn of a dial. From a business point of view, South African business will take a massive finance knock which means advertising revenues will drop and radio and television stations will see this overall. Technology has also shown that radio shows can be done from anywhere, with presenters broadcasting from their bedrooms and their lounges. We have also seen an increase in on-demand content, where content creators are using digital platforms as an outlet. This is something that has been a long time coming but the coronavirus/Covid-19 is the push that we needed..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you think is key for brands to remember when connecting with audiences via audio? Radio has always been known as the theatre of the mind. When creating audio advertising you need to find a clever way for the listener to remember your ad in 30 seconds. Some people do this with jingles, others with the use of sounds or music. You need to bring your message across and make an impact. Repetition is also something key, the listener may not have taken in all the information on the first listen, having it repeat on radio and then also available on the radio's digital platforms will give the listeners additional opportunities to interact with the ad.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1711/419535-120x120.jpg?3" alt="#Newsmaker: Kriya Gangiah shakes things up" width="120" height="120">#Newsmaker: Kriya Gangiah shakes things up'Info-tainment professional' and Jacaranda FM's digital lead, Kriya Gangiah, while still on air for the Saturday Top 20 show, recently left the station's midweek evening drive show to focus her time and energy on some undisclosed opportunities...By Jessica Tennant 22 Nov 2017.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How do you think the fourth industrial revolution will influence jobs in radio? We have already seen a great impact of the fourth industrial revolution on the radio industry, with it giving the ability to amplify its impact. Radio stations need to start thinking of themselves as holistic content producers with the opportunity to not only create traditional radio content but now they have the opportunity to create on-demand audio and visual content, live interactive and traditional events and touchpoints for listeners. It has opened up a new way of thinking about radio stations and this opens up new opportunities for jobs within the industry.

Being a digital media specialist, I see the positive influence that digital media will have on the radio industry.
