Creative, retail and lifestyle businesses have been particularly hard hit, but with help and support they are exactly the companies that will have the ability to help rebuild our society. "We hope that by showcasing these enterprises and the creative abilities of the people behind them, we can in some way lift people’s spirits and contribute to helping the people behind the designs and ideas sustain themselves through the difficult times arising from the global pandemic,” Green continued. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/550917.jpg" alt="Lulasclan by Bonolo Chepape" width="600" height="400">Lulasclan by Bonolo ChepapeNominate your favouritesMembers of the public are invited to submit their favourite projects, products, ideas or experiences from South Africa that they feel deserve to be celebrated, via the website. These submissions should have a creative element and fit into one of the five themes. It can be something new, adapted to aid in the current global situation, or something that’s been around a little longer, and must have been running or been put into production in the last three years.The initiative currently lives online, but over the course of five months, 100 Beautiful Things will evolve from a presentation of online stories into a large-scale physical exhibition to be held at the V&A Waterfront later in the year.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/549224-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Support small craft and design businesses on CDI's Peek platform" width="120" height="120">Support small craft and design businesses on CDI's Peek platformThe Craft and Design Institute is calling on South Africans to continue supporting the thousands of small businesses in the local craft and design sector during the Covid-19 lockdown...14 Apr 2020“South African creativity is boundless and comes in many forms.
