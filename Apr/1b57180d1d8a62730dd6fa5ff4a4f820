This entails donating a six-pack of eggs, 1 kilogram of maize and 1 litre of milk to the most vulnerable of South Africans,” says Good Things Guy founder, Brent Lindeque.Spar is placing shopping carts outside all of its stores for people to make these donations and encourage all South Africans to take part. “Instead of eating raw eggs, let’s give a homeless man or poor child a meal and nominate friends to do the same,” urges Lindeque.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/548940-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Pick n Pay launches 'Feed the Nation' relief fund" width="120" height="120">Pick n Pay launches 'Feed the Nation' relief fundPick n Pay has established a 'Feed the Nation' relief fund to provide food and basic hygiene essentials to the most vulnerable during the lockdown period...9 Apr 2020To drive the reach and impact of this initiative further, every time someone uses or shares the #SPARdonate hashtag, Spar will donate R1 to the Spar Southern Lodestar Foundation feeding scheme, which helps feed and nurture communities through knowledge and nutrition.“Right now, there are millions of South Africans who are going to bed hungry, but we have the ability to help. Let’s do good together and help feed the nation rather than sucking eggs,” concludes Lindeque.
