On the eve of the start to the Easter Weekend, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on 9 April 2020 that the lockdown would be extended by an additional two weeks to 30 April 2020. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/547370.jpg" alt="Covid-19 dominates the media in South Africa" width="120" height="120">Covid-19 dominates the media in South AfricaNo single story has ever dominated the global media landscape as much as the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic and its impact on health, safety and global economies...Issued by Ornico 3 Apr 2020The previous week saw increased magazine coverage as the majority of monthly magazines hit the shelves. This was a change from the week before which was filled with uncertainty as South Africa was going into lockdown with most questions unanswered, most businesses closing and online media taking centre-stage.Based on the sample of 4250 media items collected from online, print and broadcast sources for the period 8 to 14 April 2020, research shows little change in the tone of coverage. The latest week sees the president and the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize rising to the top of mentions. The extended lockdown came with increased concerns about economic impact, an increase in the number of cases and whether South Africa will need to stay indoors for much longer.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/549890-625x625.jpg" alt="Covid-19 media research in light of lockdown extension" width="625" height="625">Gauteng remained the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic in South Africa and Twitter data collected over the period shows two cities in the province to generate most of the conversations. Johannesburg accounts for 16% of mentions and Pretoria (Tshwane) comes in at 7% which makes these two cities exceptions as the only ones to appear in the Top 3 from the same province.
