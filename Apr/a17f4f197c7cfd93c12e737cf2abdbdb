More than ever, where the consumer has a deep connection with the brand, and therefore chooses to engage, with or without strong media budgets, we see business results."The Warc Awards 2020 - Effective Social Strategy shortlisted campaigns are: Bring Back the Idols · Snickers · Mars Japan · BBDO Japan · JapanNo Need to Fly - Around the World in Germany · German Rail · Ogilvy Germany · GermanySebarkan Kata Seharum Bunga - Spread Good Words as Fragrant as Flowers · Listerine · Johnson & Johnson Sdn Bhd · ensemble worldwide, Universal McCann · Malaysia#WomenRewriteWomen · El Tiempo · MullenLowe SSP3 · ColombiaCelebrating Subcultures · Burger King · Restaurant Brands International · MullenLowe US · United StatesTwitter Bait · Burger King · Restaurant Brands International · MullenLowe US · United States#NotAJoke · Change the Ref · MullenLowe US · United StatesGo Get Gifted · JetBlue · MullenLowe US · United StatesHidden Flag · The Federation (FELGTB) · Lola MullenLowe · Russian FederationBe a Masshole, Not an Asshole · Yes on 3 Coalition · MullenLowe US · United StatesScroll-Thru · KFC · Yum!
