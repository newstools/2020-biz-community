I currently work in channel marketing for an IT company..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What course are you thinking of studying at the Red & Yellow Creative School of Business and why?I’m leaning towards the Digital Marketing course. The future is digital and I’d like to be well-equipped with the knowledge of how to leverage different digital tools best..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about your experience. Why the creative industry and your field of interest?I’ve always been a storyteller but my journey in the creative industry began in film school. In final year I majored in TV Directing, Producing and Editing. I started working in my third year as a video editor at a digital agency. It was there where I learnt that my interest is broader than just video, and I decided to pursue my postgrad in Branding. I then interned at another agency and at a production company until I got my current job..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the challenges facing the industry.My biggest challenge in the industry has been the lack of nurture for young talent. It feels like creative leaders aren’t looking out for juniors, which is why platforms such as the Front Row are imperative. I constantly see posts for mid-level and senior staff but it often feels like there isn’t space for graduates and entry-level creatives to plug in and grow.Another challenge is the exploitation of those entry-level creatives once they get their foot in the door. There is nothing that comes easy but it often feels like the odds are stacked against the young black creative. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the current state of the industry/the impact of the pandemic and current lockdown on the industry.The coronavirus pandemic is going to push us to do things differently. We are forced to keep the wheels of the economy turning and I think that if we are successful, going forward, the way we work is going to change. Companies and agencies may be more open to remote working and flexible hours.Creatively, it is both an exciting and frustrating time. There are obviously limitations with some of the channels that are traditionally used but this means that there is room for opportunity with digital work.I look forward to seeing how brands are going to push the boundaries and find experimental, innovative ways to communicate. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the power of access, mentorship and collaboration in transforming the industry?The power of access and transformation means that the playing field in the industry is levelled and the work that is produced is more representative of our diverse country. It means that creative work is informed and truly authentic. Mentorship and collaboration are two valuable ways of nurturing talent whilst giving opportunity. It provides perspective when creating work, and it is another chance to learn from one another..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What does the future of the industry look like to you?The future of the industry to me looks like a transformed, inclusive space. It looks like exciting, daring creative work that celebrates South Africans, educates them and entertains them. It looks like leveraging technology and innovation in order to keep telling stories in a new way and exciting way..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to?I’m really looking forward to constantly learning, growing and taking up space in the industry. The journey has its highs and lows but I try to keep pushing myself and being better than I was the day before. I look forward to creating meaningful work and building purposeful brands in the future.Find out more about the IAB SA’s Front Row initiative here.
