Winemag.co.za introduced the awards initiative in 2015 to reward outstanding design as an influence on consumer purchases. Wine has featured since inception, beer for the last three years and now, for the first time, spirits.Judging criteria include originality of concept, execution, shelf appeal and effectiveness as a piece of communication and the adjudicators are drawn from the fields of graphic design, media and the liquor trade. This year, there were 99 wine entries in total, up from 83 in 2019; 10 beer entries down from 31 in 2019; and 30 spirits entries."The brief to the panel is to reward work that triggers an experience rather than simply being beautiful for the sake of beautiful," said Christian Eedes, editor of Winemag.co.za and judge. "In addition, we wanted to celebrate those brands that were an authentic and original expression of the South African experience wherever possible."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528043-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Best in SA packaging shine at Gold Pack Awards 2019" width="120" height="120">Best in SA packaging shine at Gold Pack Awards 2019The winners of this year's IPSA Gold Pack Awards, the premier showcase for the South African packaging industry, was announced at Inanda Club in Sandton on 30 October...By Lauren Hartzenberg 22 Nov 2019The planned awards function had to be cancelled in light of the Covid-19 pandemic but winners were announced virtually on 1 April.Gold award winnersWine<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/547089.png" alt="Winners announced for Winemag Label Design Awards 2020" width="600" height="536">Single wine selling for over R80 a bottle: Caravel Wines Bring The Ruckus Carignan 2019 REDDesign firm: Caleb Rodewald Illustration & Design (USA), Caravel Wines (RSA) & Winpak (RSA)	Single wine selling for over R80 a bottle: Springfield Estate Albariño 2019Design firm: Jan van Tonder	Single wine selling for over R80 a bottle: Warp + Weft Red Blend 2016 - Babylon's PeakDesign firm: Multi-Color CorporationBeer<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/547090.jpg" alt="Winners announced for Winemag Label Design Awards 2020" width="600" height="411">Single label: Wax On Wax Off IPA - The Kennel BreweryDesign firm: Mannemarak DesignSeries: Stellenbosch Brewing Co. - The Avenue Lager, Bosch Weiss, Born Free Pale Ale, Hoenderhok Bock, Eike StoutDesign firm: Label by Jane Says and modification for 330ml can by Lana Du Bois	Spirits<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/547091.jpg" alt="Winners announced for Winemag Label Design Awards 2020" width="600" height="492">Single label: Stillman Distillery Graphite GinDesign firm: WhitespaceSeries: De Vry Distillery - Die Droë Rooinek Dry Gin, Die Soet Rooinek Cherry Gin, Die Groot Komunis Vodka, Die Warm Rasta RumDesign firm: WhitespaceThe People’s Choice Awards<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/547095.jpg" alt="Winners announced for Winemag Label Design Awards 2020" width="600" height="541">The People’s Choice Awards, the outcome of a process of online voting by members of the public, were as follows:WineSingle wine selling for over R80 a bottle: CheNinà 2019 - Openwine and Bernhard BredellDesign firm: Michael BeckurtsBeerSingle label: Richmond Hill Brewing Company Lion's ToothDesign firm: Ashley ReidSpiritsSeries: African Craft Gin - Baobab, Honeybush, Marula - Select Beverage CompanyDesign firm: Navy CreativeAll the award-winning work is available for viewing on Winemag.co.za.
