Bizcommunity’s essential daily business-to-business information provides a snapshot overview of 19 industry sectors that helps companies keep a virtual presence alive. From government directives to daily updates on labour law, business survival plans, here’s a guide to who’s publishing what by sector right now to keep business virtual, as usual, on Biz:Marketing & MediaDuring Covid-19 the M&M and greater communications industry has shown up with stockpiles of ideas on how to weather economic crises - doing what it does best, reputation management, anticipating client needs, identifying audiences, embracing digital solutions and staying relevant. A survey by Jacaranda FM and East Coast Radio found radio to be a lifeline amid the global pandemic; we have seen virtual and online solutions in action from IAB Bookmarks migrating their awards event and monthly seminars digitally; a Loeries-led campaign inviting our creative capital to meet coronavirus pandemic challenges. The sector is ideally positioned to advise socially-isolated  audiences what to watch, listen to or consume, such as Openfield advising on how to keep marketing sports relevant, Multichoice sharing programming highlights and PR company Hewers on crisis communication best practices.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/545977-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Credit: Leo Wieling on ." width="120" height="120">Survey proves radio remains a beacon of hope amid the chaosJacaranda FM and East Coast Radio have commissioned a survey on listener attitudes and habits during the coronavirus crisis, which has proven that radio remains one of the strongest mediums amid the global pandemic...3 days agoAgricultureThe essential essential service.
