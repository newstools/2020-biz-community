How should advertisers react in these times of business as unusual?" width="625" height="203">Join our hour-long webinar on Thursday, 9 April from 12pm (GMT+2) where we discuss some considerations for creativity during Covid-19. Natalie Botha, head of creative development for Kantar in SA, shares local findings from our Covid-19 Barometer study; Daren Poole, global head of creative for Kantar, provides a global perspective on what type of creative content your brand should be putting out at the moment; and Fran Luckin, chief creative officer of Grey Africa, shares ‘A day in the life of the agency of today’. The team will share some examples of how brands have responded to leave a lasting impression in these times:Will your brand be criticised for its communications in the current situation?Consider your category’s emotional engagement. Is your brand involved in highly emotional/sensorial experiences?Messaging tips and tricksStrategically, we know that brands should invest in long-term outcomes. While the cause of the current crisis is different, the effect is similar to what we saw during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Our BrandZ data saw that the brands that continued to spend remained strongest and recovered most quickly afterwards. We look forward to seeing you ‘virtually’ on Thursday, please feel free to extend the invite to your colleagues.  Register your place hereCan’t make the date and time?
