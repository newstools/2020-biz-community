However, anything in excess of 20% is, quite frankly, something to take note of” says Mike Carter, commercial partner at RebelRebel.According to global data from Verizon, overall video game traffic has increased 75% since restrictions were imposed in America and Bungie, a video-game developer, says the average daily user engagement on their game Destiny 2 is up 10% worldwide and as much as 20% in the markets most affected by the coronavirus. Video game streaming site Twitch has also seen its average viewership more than double as e-sports viewership grows in the absence of traditional sport during this time.With regards to RapidFire, South African marketers have long supported the medium as a way to reach well-heeled gamers who are fully-attentive and focused, but with the massive growth seen in the last week, it’s worth noting that the market is now attracting many new consumers who’ve only recently plugged in to entertain themselves.“With so many new players joining the pool, and spending a lot more time across the network, the opportunity to create awareness of South African brands and their messaging during this time is huge,” says Shauna Carter, sales and operations partner at RebelRebel.“Based on the assumption that this platform would rise in terms of activity, we’re seeing growing interest from brands who’ve cut back on some of their more traditional media buys in an effort to focus on areas that are seeing increased levels of attention. It seems like the age of virtual outdoor advertising has arrived,” concludes Carter.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519558.png" alt="RebelRebel awarded African exclusivity for in-game advertising platform, RapidFire" width="120" height="120">RebelRebel awarded African exclusivity for in-game advertising platform, RapidFireFollowing the appointment of RebelRebel as exclusive sales partners for Humanz, the company is ready to unveil their next big product...Issued by RebelRebel 3 Oct 2019RebelRebel is the exclusive reseller of RapidFire inventory for the South African market.
