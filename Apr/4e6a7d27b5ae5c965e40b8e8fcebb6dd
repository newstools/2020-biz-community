<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/547263.jpg" alt="Service matters, now more than ever before" width="475" height="317">To do this, service level agreements (SLAs) are ideal for guaranteeing harmonious relationships between customers and service providers because they define what is expected from both parties. SLAs are standard to Pyrotec PackMark’s operational activities. They define its service levels, as well as how repairs and service is monitored, evaluated and measured. “Our SLAs outline sustainable service levels that don’t compromise on quality and timescales, while also providing for flexibility and unplanned problems,” notes Pyrotec PackMark’s general manager, Brandon Pearce.“We also offer assistance through our toll-free technical support helpline (0800 202 574), which is available 24/7/365 for all technical queries relating to our machines,” Pearce points out.“Having an SLA in place reduces the number of breakdowns experienced in equipment, which reduces downtime and waste. Because regular service visits are scheduled, wearing parts are identified and replaced before they fail, meaning that equipment lasts longer and performs optimally at all times,” explains Pearce.
