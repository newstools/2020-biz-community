This is skewed to older, higher income, Western Cape and Kwa Zulu Natal respondents. Less than half of Gauteng and those who earn lower income believe there will be enough essential goods.45% believe that cigarettes should be an essential good whilst only 32% believe that alcohol should be essential. Of the 68% who said that alcohol should not be an essential good, domestic safety in a lockdown environment was a concern: “Not having alcohol available, is the safest option. Alcohol inhibits a person’s mind. This is especially dangerous for people in abusive relationships” (Verbatim)We asked South Africans what other essential goods and services should be available during the lockdown. Groceries is the most sited essential need (16%), followed by hardware supplies (14%). Respondents cited the need to use their lockdown time to fix and repair items in their homes. Clothing, baby items, healthcare and take away food are also noted to be essential goods during the lockdown.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/551310.jpg" alt="Essentials un-usual" width="999" height="561">With the need to stock up on essential goods, South African’s individual finance and debt situations are under a microscope. Income security is low with only 24% of those surveyed believing they will have regular income during the lockdown and 34% think they will have regular income after the lockdown. An overwhelming 46% say they will have no income at all during the lockdown.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/551317.jpg" alt="Essentials un-usual" width="475" height="267" rel="">click to enlargeOf the 89% who have ongoing monthly payments beyond a mortgage, bank loan or credit card, only 9% find it very or extremely believable that they will receive a debt holiday during the Covid-19 crisis. 63% said a payment holiday is unbelievable or slightly believable.South Africans are thus faced with a two-fold financial burden, first of reduced income security and second of the need to have cash in order to stock on essential items to withstand the current lockdown and Covid-19 crisis.
