Issues such as critical thinking, problem solving, staying relevant amongst others. The bookings came in fast and furiously, but so did Covid-19 and everything was postponed. So, like the rest of the world, she had time to stop, think and relook this presentation to also cover the needs of clients in a post-Covid world. While the clients basic needs don’t change. There are now additional considerations agencies need to recognise in this “new normal” world.  A world that will be kinder, simpler and more collaborative. A world where ‘we’ will be more important than ‘me’. When we eventually come out of this lockdown, consumers and brands will behave differently and agencies need to be ready to adjust to this different world.“Future-proof your agency in the post Covid world. What clients want” will be launched on Monday, 20 April. It can take the form of a 90-minute presentation or workshop Via Zoom, MSTeams or in person after lockdown.
