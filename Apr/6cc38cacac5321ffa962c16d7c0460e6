In the past few weeks, Hot Cares has already made several donations of masks, gloves, sanitisers, vitamins and immune boosters to community services (SAPS, Reservists, EMS/Fire Stations) and now strongly supports Shout4Masks in this important initiative.Hot Cares donated R10,000 to the project and has called on all our listeners to please make a contribution to help protect those who are protecting us. Help ShoutSA buy safe, proper masks for our frontline heroes by donating to the Shout4Masks initiative.www.shout4masks.co.za
