The series of webinars covers a range of topics such as Sound for Video Editors, Setting up a 5.1 Session & Mix environment, Dolby Atmos Content Creation and other sound engineering topics. The first of eight webinars will go live every Thursday, starting on 16 April 2020 from 13h00–14h00 CAT. The first session focuses on Script Analysis & Planning for 5.1 Productions and is one of four webinars geared towards all content creators whilst the other four webinars are more technical and tailormade for mix engineers, video editors and system integrators. In filmmaking, sound is often overlooked yet it’s an important component of filmmaking. The Dolby Institute develops educational programming to help creatives advance in the art of storytelling, whether they’re making a film, mixing the sound for a sporting event, or designing the next-generation music experiences. As the leading video entertainment provider on the continent, MultiChoice recognises the importance of understanding sound in order to tell authentic African stories. This partnership with Dolby will benefit storytellers across the continent and support the growth of the homegrown entertainment industry.
