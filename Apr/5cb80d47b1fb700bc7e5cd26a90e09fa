<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/552254.jpg" alt="Celebrate International Jazz Day South Africa with Kaya FM and Standard Bank" width="350" height="522">With the postponement of International Jazz Day, which would have been hosted in South Africa for the first time, Kaya FM and Standard Bank have brought together an exceptional lineup of musicians to celebrate the Roots and Routes of African Jazz virtually, which viewers can access online for free. With roots that originate on the continent - jazz has travelled across borders, and sustained through memory it has found itself in many different incarnations. The theme, Roots and Routes, was developed by the hosts of International Jazz Day to raise the question of lineage, as well as to look at what makes South Africa unique in the continuous effort to place local culture, jazz and art on the world map. In exploring this conversation on this important day, we are looking at how our culture has travelled the world through our jazz artists and their engagement with people of other cultures. Through their work and music we explore how these cultural nuances have in turn impacted communities around the globe. As part of this year’s celebration we also seek to promote continuity by challenging ourselves to document and preserve this culture, which is important for both social cohesion and prosperity. The artists who are being showcased as part of the virtual International Jazz Day South Africa 2020 celebrations represent this lineage through their individual artistic convictions.“Jazz Music is a language spoken by nations of the world each with its native dialect. International Jazz Day is an opportunity to share ours with the world. Covid-19 has in a strange way forced us to remember our shared humanity and calls for us to find innovative and authentic ways to communicate. Our hosting of Jazzday2020 is a timely opportunity to elevate our country’s gene pool of jazz, by sharing the untold stories of our virtuosos, practitioners, through our various mediums and online spaces," expressed Brenda Sisane, Executive Director of International Jazz Day South Africa.
