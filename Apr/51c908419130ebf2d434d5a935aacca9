How Expressen went from 0 to 70,000 subscribers in one year.By forming a cross-functional team that worked in close collaboration to make informed, data-driven decisions, Expressen was able to go from 0 to 70,000 subscribers with Expressen Premium and not only meet their revenue target, but exceed goals for churn and retention. Judges comments: “an intense and highly successful paid content launch. Particularly impressed by the attention to detail – e.g., allowing each article on the site to have a unique message or campaign. It was also an achievement to reach these numbers when 95% of content remained free.”Members' Choice Award WinnerAgora SA, Poland (Gazeta Wyborcza) - Sell smarter: get more subscribers, earn more, reduce churn.For the first time, Wan-Ifra members had the opportunity to be the judges in one of this year’s European Digital Media Awards: Best Paid Content Strategy. After an online session where each finalist of the category pitched their projects, attendees had until April 17 to choose their favourite. After a tight vote, the members’ award goes to Gazeta Wyborcza for the successful introduction in 2019 of a new pricing strategy, drastically challenging the assumption that only discounted prices could work in their market. In the process, the strategy lowered Gazeta’s churn rate which was high because of the promotional prices. Moreover, last year has seen a record 30 per cent growth in subscriptions (to date, 240,000 digital subscribers), more people are using recurring payments and Gazeta has reached an ARPU that was seemingly unattainable before.Best News Website or Mobile ServiceZetland ApS, Denmark - Zetland’s News App.Zetland’s app is proof that data- and feedback-driven innovation can propel significant growth.
