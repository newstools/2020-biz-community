After that, they would suffer a life-long torment of addiction to class-A drugs and live on the streets.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/526483-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#EntrepreneurMonth: The sophistication of canna culture - Q&amp;A with KushKush founder Jo Hope" width="120" height="120">#EntrepreneurMonth: The sophistication of canna culture - Q&A with KushKush founder Jo HopeAfter seeing a gap in the South African market for elegantly-marketed and packaged cannabis-related products, Joanne Hope, a fashion and lifestyle entrepreneur, created KushKush - a female-centric cannabis-centred retail and content platform...By Ruth Cooper 14 Nov 2019Two decades later and the lessons I was to have learned have been turned on their head: instead of users and sellers going to prison, this plant could land up being the business and health industry injection that South Africa needs so desperately. There is an important distinction between legalisation and decriminalisation. While we live under the current ruling (decriminalisation), it is still possible for police to arrest if they see fit, with no clear guidelines. And selling cannabis is still an illegal pursuit. Legalisation would provide clear legislation keeping everyone safe. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/550405.png" alt="What is shaping culture?

He speaks of the incredible business opportunities, as well as the friends and community, he has found in the world of cannabis. The abiding tale that people tell of the cannabis world is of positivity, community, health improvement and economic freedom.Consumers, too, also still fear prosecution regardless of the decriminalised status of the plant. What really stood out during conversations with several, was that their main focus was not ‘getting stoned’ but rather their appreciation for the community that cannabis creates.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/550411.png" alt="What is shaping culture?

The director of the Cannabis Expo, Silas Howarth, expressed incredible joy at the diversity and democratisation in the industry. People from all walks of life are getting involved, helping each other and helping themselves. What they all seem to know is the immense capacity for economic growth in South Africa.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/542694-120x120.png?2" alt="The canna revolution - Q&amp;A with Cannabis Expo director Silas Howarth" width="120" height="120">The canna revolution - Q&A with Cannabis Expo director Silas HowarthThe Cannabis Expo has been postponed due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

We got in touch with expo director Silas Howarth to find out what goes into putting on an event of this nature, shifting stigmas, advice for budding entrepreneurs and CBD trends...By Ruth Cooper 12 Mar 2020As we discovered in our research, people from Africa consume almost double the amount of cannabis than those in other countries do. Africa has the land, the capacity and the desire to supply the globe, with the chance of pulling many nations out of the poverty zone and in franchising many with the opportunity for small scale farming. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/550415.png" alt="What is shaping culture?

Legal cannabis production could allow everyone to participate equitably as producers in an economy and not just be consumers. This plant is our future,“ he said. Not everyone will agree that cannabis should be legalised. However, we cannot ignore the existence of the culture, that it is immense and that it is going nowhere but forward.
