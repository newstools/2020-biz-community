Our president announced that the South African lockdown was having a positive impact in slowing the rate of infection and we must now ‘sit tight’ for a further two weeks of national lockdown. The survey also confirmed that sentiment towards the presidency is positive with an average 78.6% confidence in President Cyril Ramaphosa post his latest address. What impact has the lockdown had on your Easter weekend plans?<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/549867.jpg" alt="Easter Un-Usual" width="368" height="350">The survey investigated the impact that the lockdown had on South Africa’s Easter Weekend plans. At least 33% of those surveyed said they needed to cancel plans to spend time with their families. However, 33% said the lockdown extension had no impact on them at all. A total of 19% said they could not attend religious services and 15% needed to cancel travel plans, perhaps leading directly to fewer road accidents over the popular SA long weekend.This is the first Easter I can remember when we were not watching the death toll on our South African roads. Instead of watching the number of accidents on the evening news, South Africans entered the Easter Weekend with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address. With the Easter Un-Usual long weekend now behind us, we find ourselves entering a new world.
