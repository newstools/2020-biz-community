The Covid-19 pandemic is disrupting every industry. On the one hand, social distancing has led to a spike in at-home radio, digital and print media consumption, and growing numbers are turning to news providers for timely and trusted information on the crisis. The crisis is being well documented by radio news teams, digital news teams and print news teams.The current disruption may be unprecedented, but the media industry has been upended many times before. Since the turn of the century, digitisation of content, the rise of social media and acceleration in mobile consumption have all forced changes.At the Central Media Group, subsidiary brands and products the likes of OFM, Bloemfontein Courant, and Get It Bloemfontein, with their webpages and social media platforms, have embraced the changes in consumption, seeing between 10% and 14% rise in engagement levels, from February 2020 to April 2020. Kantar completed a research study, which indicated that terrestrial radio listenership is up 30%.In a research study conducted by the Central Media Group, with 1,545 respondents taking part in the study, it was highlighted that radio listening is on the rise, during this pandemic. Engagement with reliable news sources is also on the rise, to include the OFM news pages on ofm.co.za, and Bloemfontein Courant news page, on bloemfonteincourant.co.za.What has stayed constant is the crucial role that media play in society. Media don’t just help us pass the time; they keep us informed. Evermore, media create shared moments and reflect who we are as individuals.One of the most direct ways to gauge value is engagement, and on this front media is doing well.

Man, life can be hard. We’re all on a journey, and we’ve all been down in the dumps before, wondering if what we’re doing is worth it. Wondering if what we’re doing is making an impact. But, we must be always moving forward,” Andrew Roach. What we do is worth it! What we do makes an impact!
