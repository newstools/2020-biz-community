We will use the occasion of our one-year anniversary to review our progress and accelerate our strategy to keep growing,” adds Ngwato.“The one thing that will not change is our absolute commitment to the truth - we will always tackle the issues head-on, with people at the centre of everything we do. Our stories have the power to stir emotions and stimulate debate and we are very conscious of the great responsibility that comes with that,” emphasises Ngwato.“We have a duty, as our country grapples with the grave threat of Covid-19, to inform, but also to question and help to keep the spirit of our democracy alive during possibly its greatest test to date. We take that duty very seriously and we will honour it.”About Newzroom AfrikaNewzroom Afrika is a premier South African 24-hour television news channel broadcasting in Southern Africa, East and West Africa.
