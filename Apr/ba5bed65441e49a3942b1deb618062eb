Station of the Year winners were determined by the number of times they appeared as a finalist across all general categories of the Radio Awards. Each of the finalists submitted a further motivation which spoke to the station’s innovation, audience growth, community outreach, general achievements, as well as their 'x-factor'. This motivation was then scored by the Radio Awards advisory panel. This score accounted for the first half of a station’s final score, and the second half of the final score was determined by a station’s success in the other categories. Record number of entries“Congratulations to all of the finalists, and especially the winners for producing dynamic, captivating radio for the South African listening audience,” says Taryn Westoby, head of Arena Events which manages the Radio Awards. It’s been a challenging period in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, and making the Radio Awards happen this year – albeit on an online platform – has meant that the tireless work of radio stations around the country can be highlighted at a time when good news is really welcomed.A record number of entries (more than 2,000) were received from a record number of stations (more than 160) in this year’s edition of the Radio Awards. Entries were adjudicated by a team of 54 judges and reviewed by BDO South Africa, the newly appointed auditors for the Radio Awards. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/549084-120x120.jpg?2" alt="[Radio &amp; Podcasts] Evolving to stay in tune" width="120" height="120"> Evolving to stay in tuneWith the Radio Awards 2020 taking place later this week, Jessica Tennant interviews Taryn Westoby, head of Arena Events, who has managed the Awards since their inception in 2010, on the state of radio particularly at this time...By Jessica Tennant 2 days agoMore than 80 award winners were celebrated across 25 categories. Seven Bright Stars were announced, and five industry stalwarts were inducted into the Hall of Fame, including Brian Oxley, Gabriel Urgoiti, Neil Johnson, Peter Wise and Rev. Prince Zulu. In the two listener’s choice categories, the My Station Most Votes Award went to Ligwalagwala FM, which received the most online votes from the listening public. The My Station Loyal Listeners Award went to Hot 91.9 FM for receiving the most public votes as a ratio against its Rams figures. Inaugural Station Manager’s Choice AwardThis was also the first year for the Station Manager’s Choice Award – an award recognising the contributions made by behind-the-scenes station employees. The inaugural award was presented to two individuals: Marika de Jongh of OFM, and Linda van Schalkwyk of Pretoria FM.  The recipient of the Radio Awards Bursary Award is Nthapeleng “Tsholo” Moteka. “This year’s awards would not have happened as successfully without the firm commitment from numerous individuals. We’d like to thank the members of our advisory board, the adjudication panel, BDO South Africa and the NAB for giving of their time to ensure the Radio Awards remain relevant, credible and independent. A high bar has been set for 2021, and we look forward to the year ahead,” concludes Westoby.Station of the YearCampusMFM 92.6PukFM 93.6WINNER: Tuks FM 107.2UJFMVoice of WitsCommunityGroot FM 90.5WINNER: Hot 91.9 FMPheli FMPretoria FMRadio KhweziPBSLigwalagwala FMMotsweding FMWINNER: Radio 2000Thobela FMUmhlobo Wenene FMCommercialStation947East Coast RadioJacaranda FMWINNER: Kaya FM 95.9KFM 94.5Bright StarAlex White, RX RadioChristopher Baloyi, Kaya FM 95.9Makhosandile Mpunzi, TruFMMienke Van Rooyen, OFMSiya Motha, Voice of WitsThabang Maluleke, Kaya FM 95.9Wayne Boonzaaier, RX RadioHall of FameBrian OxleyGabriel UrgoitiNeil JohnsonPeter WiseRev.
