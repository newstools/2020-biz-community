Led by managing director Nick Kaoma, Bravado has become an authoritative leader within the industry, bringing a vibrant and energetic offering to clients and the ways they reach and connect with their consumers. In its short time, Bravado has acquired an impressive roll of clients and produced impressive results for brands independently as a specialist agency, and as part of integrated services that Brave Group offers. "We're truly honoured to be entrusted with expanding our offering to the rest of the Danone portfolio. Our collaboration with the Danone team is premised on forward-thinking initiative and creativity, and we look forward to expanding the successful results of our partnership across the new roster of Danone brands," Nick Kaoma says.Mohammed Jassat, senior marketing manager at Danone says: "We are pleased to grow our relationship with Bravado. Their work on DanUp, Inkomazi and YogiSip has been exceptional and their approach to experiential marketing resonates with our objective to grow our presence, our market share, and our ambitions. We look forward to taking this new step in our journey together, and a strengthened long-term partnership."
