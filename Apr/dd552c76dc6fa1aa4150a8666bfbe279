Staff remunerationIn a trading update issued on Monday, the company confirmed that it will continue to remunerate all staff, and those who are part of the essential workforce will receive an additional 'appreciation payment' for the duration of the current lockdown period. Woolworths has also implemented a range of initiatives to support employees during this time, including alternative working hours to more flexible practices like work-from-home, leveraging a "full suite of technology tools" to make this happen.The group reported that sales in its food business rose 27.6% in the four weeks to end-March, while sales at Woolworth’s fashion and home business fell 27.8% over the same period as customers shifted to essential products.Commenting on its food business, Woolworths assured that "strong supplier partnerships" are ensuring a consistent supply of product. "The period immediately prior to the lockdown saw unprecedented demand on specific products that consumers considered essential. This demand has begun to moderate, as shopping patterns are re-set and as confidence in the food supply chain grows."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/547347-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Lockdown shopping: Retailers ramp up in-store safety measures" width="120" height="120">Lockdown shopping: Retailers ramp up in-store safety measuresSome of South Africa's largest retailers have introduced additional safety measures, including barrier screens at till points and protective visors...By Lauren Hartzenberg 3 days agoImpact on business performanceThe company said the impact of the Covid-19 virus is being felt across all markets in which it operates.
