As part of the Bruno Kessler Foundation’s Centre for Information and Communication Technology, he developed a screening tool to identify how much of public messaging, in each country, is in fact reliable. Using machine learning techniques, over 120 million geolocated tweets and 22 million webpages were analysed. 88 countries have since been included in order to track online speculation as well as track bots spreading fake news.So, how did South Africa do?A few shameful videos aside, South Africa is proving to be one of the most reliable countries in the world when it comes to Covid-19 news. After Singapore, who take top honours, we have the lowest infodemic risk percentage – which means low exposure to fake information. The infodemic risk index takes into account the average amount of content posted each day, the truth reliability of native news and the truth reliability of bot-generated content.SA overview:Average of 19,574 Covid-related tweets daily in SA.We’re 2nd in the world when it comes to reliable news.77.8% of all our Twitter Covid content is reliable.SA’s “infodemic” risk is 0.005%.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/549191.png" alt="Source: ." width="625" height="251">Source: Covid19 Infodemics Observatory.To better understand this, we can compare ourselves to other countries. The UK currently has a 27x higher risk of misinformation than we do, and in the USA, you have a 56x higher risk of being exposed to fake news than here in SA.When asked about our news reliability, lead researcher De Domenico said “Congratulations, South Africa is a very reliable news country”.With fake news proving to be a real threat to our health, it’s important for us all to keep our news reliable by practising digital hygiene in the same way we do physical hygiene.Digital hygiene tips:SourceCheck to see if the news is also being reported on mainstream sites (like this one). If the source is “a friend of a friend”, treat it as a rumour and discard it. The government site https://sacoronavirus.co.za > News & Updates is a good place to check for reliable information.Content qualityCredible news sites are less likely to have typos, spell things incorrectly or use poor grammar. Text in colour, capital letters and the overuse of exclamation marks should also make you suspicious.Encouraging you to shareFake news thrives when it’s shared. If the message asks you to forward it to your network, be wary. Remember – fake news can only spread if we spread it.Report fake news Fake news about Covid-19 is now a criminal offence in South Africa. If you receive information that you suspect to be fake news, take a screenshot or copy the link and report it to fakenewsalert@dtps.gov.zabRev('brev-b1167223-07c5-42f6-b955-14f6ccc10606', '>a/\<az.vog.sptd@trelaswenekaf>"az.vog.sptd;46#&trelaswenekaf:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or WhatsApp 067 966 4015.Visit the Covid19 Infodemics Observatory to view real-time stats on news reliability around the world.
