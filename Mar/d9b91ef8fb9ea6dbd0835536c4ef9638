Within a mere 12 months, we (largely) went from shaming those who were not drinking to warming to the idea that an alcohol-free life is not only achievable, but desirable.Our parents used to drink and drive as if it was totally normal. Younger generations have almost entirely replaced ‘one for the road’ with vocal disapproval when someone overindulges. DJ Angela Weickl is one of those who spoke specifically about casual drinking, as opposed to the more obvious versions of alcoholism. This is a conversation that is starting to emerge more and more, with people becoming less and less tolerant of their casual habits and wishing to stop entirely, or at least drink less. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/537052.png" alt="What is shaping culture? Free from alcohol" width="625" height="312" rel="">click to enlargeAt the beginning of 2019, one of the issues confronting non-drinkers was the absolute dearth – with the exception of The Duchess and 0.0% beers – of options available to them. Rock shandies, sparkling water and Coca-Cola are hardly the hallmarks of a lovely evening out. During the year, the vacuum began to slowly fill – The Duchess and 0.0% beers started to make their mark, the interest in Kombucha grew and Vermont Vergin non-alcoholic gin burst on to the scene. The conversation, too, grew with the inaugural Mindful Drinking Festival taking place late in 2019. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/520404-120x120.jpg?2" alt="New alcohol-free Mindful Drinking Festival to launch in Cape Town" width="120" height="120">New alcohol-free Mindful Drinking Festival to launch in Cape TownThe Mindful Drinking Festival will be held at the Kirstenbosch Stone Cottages in Newlands, Cape Town on 20 October 2019...9 Oct 2019Liquid chefs like Siavash Behaein are also getting in on the act and experimenting with alternatives to alcohol in cocktails, including using seeds and interesting fermentation techniques.

The culture encourages people to choose a lifestyle that helps them pursue behaviours and products to become the best version of themselves that they can be. And alcohol isn’t one of them.
