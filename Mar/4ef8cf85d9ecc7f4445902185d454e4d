The modern marketing agencyAt Ogilvy, for example, we talk about being a modern marketing agency (as opposed to simply a brand communications agency), which means that technology is an integral part of our communications offering. Ultimately, it is this integrated-communications approach that allows us to successfully connect with today’s digitally enabled consumer. This opens enormous opportunities for digital skills. To be competent in marketing communications, experts need to understand all aspects of mobile, social and digital platforms, as well as they do traditional media. This includes, not only knowing their platform advantage and usages but their specifications and audience. In addition to the abovementioned, the right mix of deep digital expertise, technology, data and influence capabilities is needed within one’s overall talent mix. This refers to talent with niche data, UX/UI, e-commerce, data strategy, influence, tech and development for experience design and marketing technology (martech).

Attracting and developing young talent in this space is a necessary investment to grow talent for the industry. Change remains the only constant, and to be fit for purpose in the future, talent must be exposed to learning opportunities that fuel their curiosity, and motivate them to be brave, adaptive and curious.Modern marketing is on a transitional journey toward mastering and enriched personalisation enabled through robust data integrity.
