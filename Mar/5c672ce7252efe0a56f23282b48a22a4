It’s not either/or. The now is the stuff you need to do today; the stuff your clients pay you for. But if you don’t focus on the next, you won’t be relevant in future. When you live in the-now-and-the-next in a marketplace that’s changing at warp speed, you have to face the now minute-to-minute, while the next is materialising simultaneously. It really is about the-now-and-the-next. - Peter Khoury, CCO, TBWA\Hunt\LascarisOther special honourees included Best Digital Students, Kyle Gounden and Lesego Molaudi of Vega; Best Digital Youngster, Nosipho Maseko of Joe Public United; Best Digital Marketer, Jessica van der Westhuyzen of OneDayOnly and Best Online Journalist, Thomas Holder of Primedia Broadcasting.
