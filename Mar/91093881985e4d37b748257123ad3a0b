The type of business problems they are asking us to help solve cannot be solved with a single-minded focus and most of the time it requires a collective set of skills to answer the brief.''Lintvelt continues: “We are finding that most of the times the strategic solves lie in the way we utilise our own proprietary data and research that we have invested in SSA for a while now and how we combine that with the information the client has regarding their consumers or sales patterns. That really dictates the direction we will go within our business such as the media, content and creative approaches.”For further information contactJaco LintveltManaging director for Dentsu Data LabsT: +27 21 442 5600E: Jaco.Lintvelt@dentsuaegis.combRev('brev-51bbbec6-707b-4d61-9f2a-2cdfe5177696', '>a/\<moc.sigeaustned@tlevtniL.ocaJ>"moc.sigeaustned;46#&tlevtniL.ocaJ:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')
