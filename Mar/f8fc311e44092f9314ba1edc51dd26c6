One success story was the collaboration with the IIE Vega campuses where Honours graduates from the strategic brand communication and strategic brand management fields, together with undergraduates in brand, creative and digital marketing programmes, were trained to not only use the Choices platform but also design relevant outputs for clients during their Brand Challenge Week. From an academic and corporate perspective, it is important to empower young millennials and Generation Zs with the right information, research skillsets and databases to enable them to make informed decisions for the brands they will represent in the corporate world. “This invaluable collaboration enabled our students to engage with ‘real world’ technology and information to develop brand-building strategies and campaigns based on informed insights and messaging. The bridge between theoretical constructs and practical application is one that Vega crosses at every opportunity to ensure that our students have a realistic and holistic perspective of brand-business practice.” (Michele O’Hara: National Brand Challenge Navigator 2019).<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/542953.jpg" alt="The Target Group Index (TGI) data set - Empowering students and business leaders of tomorrow alongside the University of Pretoria" width="499" height="703" rel="">click to enlargeIn 2020, Ask Afrika is rolling out this initiative to more tertiary institutions. In partnership with the University of Pretoria’s Department of Marketing Management and Enterprises University of Pretoria, a new course on 'Utilising the Target Group Index for Practical Market(ing) Insights' is available.  This two-day short course aims to equip marketers, data scientists, engineers, analysts and business consultants with the theoretical background in marketing followed by the practical skillset to utilise TGI’s database. Delegates are sure to refresh, rethink and reshape their current and future use of data to drive market(ing) decisions. This hands-on course could be the key to unlock deeper insights from existing data, directly impacting the triple bottom line. “Learning how to link market(ing) strategies with the available data in the TGI Choices database will ensure that delegates don't fall prey to motivating decisions but instead utilise the database to its full potential resulting in impactful strategies.” (Dr Liezl-Marié van der Westhuizen: Senior lecturer, Department of Marketing Management, University of Pretoria).Three training dates are available:24-25 March 202023-24 June 202028-29 September 2020Course fees per delegate are R5,500 (excl.
