I went to the President’s Investment Summit in 2018, our new acting President at that time, gathering all economic stakeholders under one roof to commit towards this ‘new dawn’. I looked around the room and this new dawn looked like a patriarchy establishment and the few women leaders were all too familiar, and then you wonder, how can you affect change in any way possible?.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} Why are you particularly passionate about women economic empowerment and gender equality? I have always been an activist and a feminist, firmly believing that in order for us all to thrive and reach our full potential, be confident and make a contribution to society and that the power parity should be both social and economic. For generations, we have witnessed how slow this transformation has been.

Be constantly motivated and choose to be around people that are passionate. Stay away from the noise. Connect and network with people that nourish your soul, are authentic and help pursue your dreams and goals. We should all be advocates of driving this agenda for us and our future generations.The greater inclusion of women in the economy could be the elixir to reduce unemployment, poverty and inequality.
