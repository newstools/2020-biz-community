We too have to play our part in avoiding activities, including events such as the brand summit, that might go against national, continental, and global efforts to combat the continued spread of Covid-19. This is particularly important because brand summit speakers and delegates come from all over the world, including different parts of Africa, West & East Europe, Asia, and North America. Several of them already face travel restrictions imposed by their own countries. They all need time to allow the growth curve of the pandemic to flatten-up and stop. We believe that moving the brand summit from June to October 2020 will allow our world sufficient time to get to grips with and contain this terrible pandemic.”  Registrations for the 2020 Brand Summit Africa remain open at:  www.sabrandsummit.co.za/register/.
