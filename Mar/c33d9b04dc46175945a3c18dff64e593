More so than ever before, this thinking needs to be debated and shared for all to benefit.” The discussion will be staged and streamed for free by professionals in the event industry in exchange for a revenue split of money made by subscriptions to the stream, he said. “To make this work and to assist marketers and their service providers equally, we need corporates to back this initiative, industry professionals to offer their time and insights and marketing professionals to engage, and continue these crucial conversations.” I interviewed Ross to find out his views on the impact of the pandemic on the industry and why he thought to initiate this series…“The event industry has been especially hard hit with almost all companies servicing the sector having seen a significant impact on their immediate business pipelines as well as future order books. It has affected all aspects of the industry from venues, décor suppliers, caterers, content production companies, technical suppliers, event management agencies and even transport companies. In the UK many of the large tech firms have started using their large trucks to pull groceries for Tesco’s instead of sound systems for Madonna, just to generate some income.”.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is the biggest challenge facing the industry at the moment?The biggest factor is undeniably the short-term decimation of order books as well as the medium-term uncertainty around when things will get going again. It makes the entire scenario virtually impossible to predict and as a result has left a significant portion of the industry in limbo regarding any form of certainty around getting back on our feet..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did this online event/panel discussion come about?We acknowledge the challenges the marketing industry, in general, are facing and saw no attempts to curate a common conversation around the challenges brands are facing in this unprecedented situation. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/543756-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: ." width="120" height="120">Marketing in the Covid-19 ageThose of us in marketing have to be concerned with questions concerning the impact of Covid-19 on our work, our clients and the impact on the industry.

I doubt three weeks ago any South African brand had an opinion on “brand voice in a pandemic” yet now every single brand in the country is facing exactly this challenge. If we can provide a platform for both industry-leading opinion and a meaningful Q&A section, surely every brand manager and agency strategist in the country can benefit from this..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What would you say to encourage corporates and industry folk to listen in and support the initiative?We have to date seen an almost entire lack of support from corporates for this initiative. Whilst we acknowledge the significant challenges facing us all, we believe corporate South Africa can and should be supporting this, and other initiatives by SMEs to ensure there is indeed a valid pool of professionals around to support their efforts when the doors open up, and things return to as normal as can be expected.We urge all SMEs to mail us as access is free for all qualifying parties. If corporate SA does not want to support this initiative, we still serve a valuable service as, in this situation, knowledge is power and we hope we are able to provide that to brand teams, agencies, corporates and SMEs alike.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/544204.jpg" alt="SMEs must prepare for the impact of Covid-19" width="120" height="120">SMEs must prepare for the impact of Covid-19Businesses will bear the brunt of social distancing practices and disrupted supply chains caused by the outbreak of Covid-19...20 Mar 2020.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s next?We are already working on the second edition of ‘Going Viral’ which will be an in-depth discussion on the challenges and solutionist thinking required for SMEs to survive, given their unique ability to react and reinvent in the fraction of the time of large corporates. There is a positive side to this situation and we hope to profile this through relevant discussions in episode two.Supporting businesses and industry has never been more important. Although there’s much uncertainty, what is clear is that we need to work together and create solutions for the greater good of society and the economy in general.For more info, email Andrew@chaostheory.co.zabRev('brev-dc4483e6-be70-4c32-a41b-c7748bd2afc8', '>a/\<az.oc.yroehtsoahc@werdnA>"az.oc.yroehtsoahc;46#&werdnA:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
