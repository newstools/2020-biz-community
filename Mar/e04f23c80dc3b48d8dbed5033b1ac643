But this also comes with its own challenges.An example in our industry is that as Generation Z (those born from 1995) start to enter the job market, we will be seeing significant changes in the ways that brands and consumers communicate as digital behaviours are expected to shift – faster than they did before. As we head into the 4IR (4th Industrial Revolution), Gen Z’s efforts are going to be more focused on using technology that allows for more personal and financial independence, diversity and competitiveness.Ever-evolving digital ecosystemThis audience is typically a self-starter, self-motivator and self-learner who place a premium on do-it-yourself, innovation and entrepreneurship activities. They respond to open, honest and timely messaging and prefer in-person, collaborative and transparent communication. Which of course leads to massive corporates like Google adapting to their consumer demands by providing more transparency, greater privacy, choice, and control over how their data is used. This will lead to the death of cookie data which will significantly change the way we use cookies to understand our audiences. Without cookie data, we are going to have to adapt our approach because for the past couple of years we've been using cookie data to track our website visitors, improve the user experience, and collect data that helps us target ads to the right audiences. We also use them to learn about how and what these website visitors are browsing online when they aren't on our websites.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/545797-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Credit: hj barraza on ." width="120" height="120">Five ways to digitally market your company during the lockdownMkhuseli Vangile, MD of DCF PR and marketing agency suggests that PR be approached in a creative way by utilising 5 key elements in digital PR...By Mkhuseli Vangile 26 Mar 2020We certainly have our work cut out for us in this ever-evolving digital ecosystem.
