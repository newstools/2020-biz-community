Recently, Black Wolf Agency completed its third year in business and is now looking at expanding the company's service offerings. Here, Wolf tells us more about what this exactly entails and explains what sets them apart from other full-service marketing agencies....bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Talk us through the context of launching Black Wolf Agency.Because of the initial setup (only offering consulting services), we depended on execution partners to deliver on creative and digital work. But between the high costs and low-value return, we recognised the challenges on the brand side to find the right partners. We decided to offer implementation services to our existing client base as a means to fill this gap.To ensure we had an attractive pricing point to market, we kept costs low by incorporating an internal freelance contract model. However, these models are challenging to develop a healthy work culture. After attracting initial investment, we have since shifted toward a full-time employment model. Since our launch in 2016, and as from the end of 2018, we have shifted toward a full-time employment model. We now have 11 full-time and four contract employees offering a full-service marketing suite of services.
