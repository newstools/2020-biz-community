The software also offers an “in-store” live feedback tool which allows reviews to be dealt with immediately, offline. “Social Places understands the importance of having early detection of any sensitive issues, particularly about any potential Coronavirus cases during this time. Further to this, hygiene issues have become extremely important for our clients who have multiple locations in the restaurant, retail, finance and fitness space” says Ashleigh Wainstein, co-founder of Social Places.  In a recent online consumer review survey that was conducted by Social Places towards the end of 2019, statistics showed that 89% of consumers read online reviews to make a decision about a business, whilst 92% of consumers expect a business to respond to an online review.  “These statistics highlight the importance of review management at all times and prove to be particularly useful during this period, where businesses are in a vulnerable position.” says Wainstein. 							Social Places work with some of South Africa’s leading brands in the restaurant and retail space and to date, have consolidated almost 2 million online reviews for their customers.
