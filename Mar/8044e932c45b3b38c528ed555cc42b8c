While the vigilance to stop the spread of the disease has been commendable, in 2020 we will almost certainly face the socio-economic impact that could be far greater than what was witnessed with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) global outbreak of 2003. The speed of recovery will be determined by the severity and duration of the outbreak, but for now, things remain uncertain.It is, therefore, imperative that marketers equip themselves with agile strategies that can help navigate the potential obstacles and barriers to revenue and success; and it is key that they address how best to deliver for their customers in this challenging climate. The following is an essential guide, developed by Dentsu, to provide insight, counsel and guidance for every marketer; and it will hopefully give them ideas for how they can stay vigilant, relevant and successful. The economic impactChina represents 18% of the global economy and ⅓ of the economic growth. This is expected to contribute to $160bn in losses. Other key markets contributing to these losses are Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong. Chinese tourism and export to the US will reduce US economic growth by 0.4% this quarter – the impact on Australia will be double that.Key industries are being negatively affected, but there will also be industries that will benefit. While the effect on tourism is obvious, the shutdown of factories is limiting the supply of brands like Apple (10% decline in shipment in Q1). Industry impactThe launch of seven movies has been delayed due to the declining attendance at movie houses in the first quarter of the year, but since so many people are self-isolating, gaming revenue is up substantially in that quarter, and online video has skyrocketed globally. Communication and collaboration platform DingTalk has been in high demand, since virtual meetings have become more popular.We have already experienced a major decline in tourism and retail (about 20% in highly affected markets). China Airlines has just implemented a 10% pay cut for all airline executives to assist the ailing airlines during this period. Retail sales in-store have fallen by 20% as well. Biotech and smart technology businesses have seen a major increase in usage and sales. The biggest swing is in unmanned tech services like clinic supply tracking and fulfillment, unmanned retail and self-service restaurants. It is safe to say it is not ‘business as usual’.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/544114.png" alt="Covid-19 global impact - an essential guide for marketers in Africa" width="432" height="242">How brands are reactingIn many countries there is already a major economic effect due to Covid-19.
