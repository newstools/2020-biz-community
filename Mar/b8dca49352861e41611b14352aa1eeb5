Image supplied.Compiled by Warc, the international marketing information company, the Creative 100 Ranking is produced by combining the results of the industry's most important global and regional creative award shows tracked throughout 2019. The awards tracked are determined by the Warc Rankings Advisory Board and a worldwide industry survey.The Whopper DetourBurger King's The Whopper Detour, by FCB New York, is the most creatively celebrated campaign of 2019. Designed to increase Burger King app users, the campaign involved the geofencing of rival McDonald's restaurants with customers having to be in the vicinity of a McDonald's store to unlock a Whopper-for-one-cent promotion. Mobile sales tripled during the promotion and the chain saw the highest number of store visits in four years. Burger King estimated the campaign earned it a 37-1 return on investment.Gabriel Schmitt, co-chief creative officer, FCB New York, comments: "We are extremely humbled and honoured by this recognition. 'The Whopper Detour' was a unique idea because it not only broke through from a creative standpoint, it also drove significant business results, solving a real business problem through creativity. The most successful campaigns should grow brands and their bottom line, and we are happy to see 'The Whopper Detour' being recognised for doing just that."All the high rankersIn second place is lip-sync music video Viva La Vulva, a campaign for feminine hygiene brand Bodyform/Libresse by AMV BBDO London.

McCann Worldgroup is in second place and DDB Worldwide third.David Lubars, chief creative officer Worldwide and creative chairman, BBDO Worldwide, comments: What makes me most proud of topping the Warc Creative 100 for the second year in a row is that it's not just one agency or campaign.
