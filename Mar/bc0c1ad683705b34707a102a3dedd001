Realising WhatsApp – South African’s most used social media platform – presents the next frontier for engaging with consumers on an even more intimate level, Lancewood approached Techsys Digital to strategise how the brand could meet certain objectives via the messaging app. The key objective for the campaign would be engaging with fans in a fun way on the platform they already trust and love most, in order to build up Lancewood’s WhatsApp database. The brand also wanted to reward their loyal customers with a digital voucher that would be easy to redeem and would help their fan base discover the new Spread Delight range. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/544019-625x306.jpg" alt="Lancewood Cheese unlocks the power of WhatsApp with Techsys Digital" width="625" height="306">Techsys crafted a solution that could meet those objectives, as well as surprise and delight Lancewood’s ardent fans.  The first step was to leverage the brand’s highly engaged social media audience with a promoted post that clicked through to the Lancewood WhatsApp line.  Having landed on WhatsApp, consumers were rewarded with an entry into the Grand Prize Draw to stand to win a year’s worth of Lancewood cheese! Next, fans found out if they’d won a digital voucher. Winners received their voucher over WhatsApp and could drop their location pin to find their nearest participating store. To earn additional entries in the Grand Prize Draw, as well as another chance to win a voucher, participants could provide details to help enrich the brand’s understanding of its core consumers. Once a consumer’s journey on the WhatsApp line had completed, they received access to a host of scrumptious recipes they could prepare with their new Lancewood products. A few days after being awarded their voucher, consumers who hadn’t redeemed yet received an SMS gently reminding them to treat themselves at their next shop.And treat themselves they did! Over 50% of the vouchers distributed were redeemed, beating the benchmark of 10 to 20%. The Grand Prize Draw received over 41,000 entries, showing that people love their Lancewood and they love a competition with a convenient, easy entry mechanic. Lancewood attracted over 10,000 new consumers to the line, proving that for mobile engagement, WhatsApp is the place your customers want to be. What is clear is that consumers love and trust WhatsApp, so why not move your conversation to them?
