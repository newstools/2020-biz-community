Even Kentucky" width="475" height="267">And now, in the next instalment of the campaign, they’ve taken the concept a step further.Unique to South Africa is the fact that locals still call Chicken Licken®’s biggest competitor ‘Kentucky’. So, they decided to get the home of this competitor talking too, by putting up an EasyBucks® billboard in the last place you’d expect: Kentucky USA. The price of R24 was converted into US dollars, translating to a ridiculously low $1,60. And that certainly got Kentucky talking! The team filmed the locals’ reactions to the billboard, the low price and their eagerness to try Chicken Licken®, in order to create an online film. Directed by Joe Public United Film Director, Katlego Baaitse and produced by Burley Boys Productions, it’s a lovely, entertaining peek into the lives of salt-of-the-earth Kentuckians and, of course, a cheeky poke at the competition. The film went live on 25 March 2020 and is expected to get South Africa talking about EasyBucks® yet again.Brand: Chicken LickenClient: Chantal Sombonos van TonderAgency: Joe Public UnitedGroup chief creative officer: Pepe MaraisChief creative officer: Xolisa DyeshanaCreative director: Assaf LevyArt director: Zamani NgubaneCopywriter: Caroline BerghStrategy: Leigh TaylerAccount management: Amber Mackeurtan, Asbo Ofori-AmanfoAgency TV producer: Wendy BothaProduction company: Burley BoysDirector: Katlego BaaitseDirector of photography: Barend Stofberg Executive Producer: Daryl BurleyProducer: Warren Burley Post-production: Burley BoysEditor: Barend StofbergColourist: Alex MayOnline operator: Hofmeyr Smit Audio: Warren Burley
