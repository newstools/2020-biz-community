This wave’s report covers more than 240 multinational and local companies, with over 600 client-agency relationships analyzed. More agency engagements, but shorter partnershipsChinese marketers work with 6.6 agencies on average, the highest number in our benchmark across eight countries. This increase of 13.7% (2018) is largely attributed to increased engagement with BTL and Digital agencies as the number of netizens continue to grow in China. Though the country’s dynamic marketing environment has led to more opportunities for agencies, it has resulted in a decrease in the duration of client-agency relationships. Chinese marketers work with agencies for an average of 3 years, significantly below the global benchmark of 4.6 years.“In previous studies, we had observed a trend towards stabilisation of marketer-agency agencies relationship, with marketers consolidating their accounts with fewer agency partners in 2018. But as the media landscape becomes more fragmented, and integrated capability is still lacking, it is inevitable that marketers will be seeking more expertise”, says Vacchiano.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/546520.png" alt="Agency Scope China study shows the impact of an increasingly fragmented ecosystem" width="625" height="357" rel="">click to enlargeMarketers turn to specialisation in lieu of integrationMore marketers are working with integrated solutions provided by holding companies, but the majority still prefer to seek out expert vendors. 31.3% of survey participants said they would prefer to work with integrated agencies, compared to 68.7% who voiced a preference to have specialist capability operating within each discipline.Aside from brand communication, media, and events are two areas where Chinese marketers are looking for agencies with a deep understanding of trends and consumer behaviour and a record of performance. Given the unique ecosystem that operates in China, holding companies without strong regional and local presence do not seem to be able to deliver as well as localised agencies.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/546522.png" alt="Agency Scope China study shows the impact of an increasingly fragmented ecosystem" width="625" height="357" rel="">click to enlargeThe popularity of pitch, procurement and in-housingThe relationship between marketing and procurement is improving with 60.7% of professionals surveyed saying that both departments are equal partners on the agency selection process. Pitch remains the most popular selection method, with 91.5% of marketers opting to use this approach, with an increase in the use of workshops and chemistry sessions. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/546524.png" alt="Agency Scope China study shows the impact of an increasingly fragmented ecosystem" width="625" height="357" rel="">click to enlargeMarketers are still of bringing certain functions in-house as they feel that such teams have better knowledge about market, consumers and the brand (35.2%) and that in-housing delivers cost savings and increased efficiency (33%).Increased acceptance of paying for performanceIncentive payments are becoming more accepted in China as marketers try to find ways to motivate agencies and reward performance. 14.3% of marketers have an incentive payment as part of their remuneration system, up from 8.1% in 2018, though the number is still below the global average of 24.5%. More than 50% of marketers would agree to negotiate higher fees for improved quality of agency services.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/546526.png" alt="Agency Scope China study shows the impact of an increasingly fragmented ecosystem" width="625" height="357" rel="">click to enlargeHuawei ranked in the Top 3 for brand respect and best campaignsApple and Huawei are the top two companies most respected in China for their marketing. Huawei has made strides in growing loyalty and favour with Chinese consumers over the past two years thanks to its increased visibility and symbolism as a national brand. Huawei’s position as the company with the “Best Campaigns” over the past two years has jumped from 21st position to 3rd. Nike was the only other company besides Huawei to rank in the top three, jumping to 1st place as the brand with the “Best Campaigns” and ranking 3rd for “Most Respected” in their marketing.
