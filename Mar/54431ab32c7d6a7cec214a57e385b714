“A product like this is only as good as the underlying data,” says Daryl van Arkel, CEO of Vicinity Media. “We source location data through integrating our bespoke technology directly with SA’s top publishers, where opted-in first-party user data is acquired, thus our data is unrivalled in the South African market.”Vicinity looks up, collects and processes 33 million coordinates every month meaning plenty of ‘Big Data’ for our clients to garner unique insights. The tool has been built with a large degree of flexibility to address the surfacing of insights and allow the user to have free reign. Both client and agency partners have collaborated within the product spec process in order to build a tool that serves internal and external needs.“We look forward to pushing the envelope even further with this product, as we continue to develop it. We as a local tech company, are in a unique position in that we can build to the needs and desires of local clients, and it brings us great pleasure to release features that our clients have asked for,” adds van Arkel.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/545359-625x351.png" alt="Get to know your audience with real 1st party location data" width="625" height="351">Vicinity has already seen very interesting use cases surface from clients, ranging from how to better plan out-of-home media based on audience interest or the location of consumers in-market for a product or service. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/545362-625x297.png" alt="Get to know your audience with real 1st party location data" width="625" height="297">In other use cases, clients can compare performance versus delivery hotspots, dwell points and visitation habits in stores and shopping malls.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/545364-625x297.png" alt="Get to know your audience with real 1st party location data" width="625" height="297">The Visualiser has the capability to filter by publishers, campaigns, time periods, in-market segments, clicks, engagements, and impressions.
