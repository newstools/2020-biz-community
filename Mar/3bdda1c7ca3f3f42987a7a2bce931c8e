Juan José Posada, the CCO of Geometry Latam, and Luis Marqués (associate founder of M&A Creative – Portugal) are some of the other renowned industry leaders who will present at Wina 2020.GLOBAL<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/499452-120x120.jpg" alt="Wina announces shortlist for 2019" width="120" height="120">Wina announces shortlist for 2019Wina announced its shortlist for the 2019 competition with South African creative advertising agency, Kilmer & Cruise featuring in four categories...31 May 2019The Wina 2019 edition, was celebrated at the Grand Hyatt Bogotá, where a total of 284 medals were awarded to networks and independent communication agencies from 5 continents, with the participation of 29 countries that accessed the live online stream of the event on Youtube.Important dates:Agency Enrollment Open: As of 20 JanuaryStart Date for Case Evaluation: As of 27 JanuaryEnrollment Deadline: 28 AprilAwards Ceremony: 12 June/Online
