We are hopeful that in the very near future Covid-19 will pass and we can, right from now, look forward to the recovery period, which will certainly come. The best thing we can do, in the short term, is to maintain an audience-first approach; be fast; flexible and agile; to cater to the shift in media consumption and entertainment sources and, most importantly, prepare a smart and solid action plan for when life gets back to normal. To start with, we need to be very mindful of: the continuum of pandemic phases.The Figure 1 below shows the World Health Organization’s “Continuum of Pandemic Phases,” displayed as a distribution curve of the hypothetical global average of pandemic cases over time-based on a continued pandemic risk assessment.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/545962.png" alt="Covid-19 fallout - How brands should respond to declining sales" width="625" height="324">We also need to bear in mind that a pandemic will always follow with a recovery phase. Thus, whilst we need to prepare for the short term the long run will remain just as important.The figure below shows the Covid-19 global cases as at 27 March 2020:<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/546000.png" alt="Covid-19 fallout - How brands should respond to declining sales" width="625" height="291">Now, what does Covid-19 mean for brands? Among other things, it means that brands should: A. Maintain a consumer-first mindset – In this regard, it is important to maintain a sense of optimism with sensitive brand messaging; reflect local consumers sentiment, emotional context and cultural norms with a utility approach; consider the context of media placements, and maintain authenticity and support in messaging and content.B. Think short term but don’t forget the long-term vision - To ensure this, brands must: Have short-term calibration plan but also keep the long term vision in focus; Responsibly maintain ad spend to win hearts and minds longer-term and SOV; and Continue mass awareness, media activities but with the right message for the climate.C.

Advertising activity relies on a number of business events and trade fairs that are at risk of cancellation; and marketing and advertising spend is partly linked to tent pole events, (mainly sports), that are also at risk. We are now seeing blanket bans on professional sport and events across the globes and locally. The biggest impact will, of course, come from the Olympic Games postponement till 2021. We should expect marketing and advertising spend to be lower this year, if only because attendance by visitors, sponsors, and advertisers is likely to be below expectations based on a statistical analysis of advertising.Impact on consumer behaviour and audience supply:The obvious behavioural impact of a severe outbreak is that people will travel less and stay home more to avoid exposure. This may be exacerbated further if companies begin to recommend or mandate working from home. We can reasonably assume that TV usage of all types will increase if this is the case. Daytime TV and News viewing is likely to increase as kids and office workers are at home for the next few weeks. In our opinion, the big winners in this scenario will be the streaming services, as a self (or mandated) quarantine situation is ideal for binge viewing, and the influx of new services means there is more content on offer than ever.We have already seen this sentiment take hold on Wall Street, as analysts seem to share our opinion, and Netflix’s stock price was positively impacted. The big winners will definitely be the streaming services.Impact on advertising costs:Increases in viewing and decreased demand from several economic sectors could potentially lead to lower media costs for advertisers, e.g. lower cost on television. We have already some digital publishers seeing a slowdown in ad spend as recently the last week in February, which could be a sign that advertisers are beginning to pull back on media that is easily cancellable. Lower prices are likely to happen in the short term and may present a good opportunity to increase SOV in this period of uncertainty; however, we will caveat that this may not be a long term trend.How other brands are dealing with the threat:Maintain empathy, kindness and sense of community and optimism actions and messagingDiscover new opportunities in virtual environmentsAlways maintain safety and hygiene and don’t seek to capitalise off the epidemicEmpathy and kindness:Microsoft is offering a six-month free trial to the premium version of its Microsoft Teams business, chat/collaboration application, a part of the Office 365 suite.
