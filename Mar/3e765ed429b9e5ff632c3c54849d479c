Cipla will be sponsoring three Mental Health Journalism Fellowships for 2020, in the fields of print, broadcast and online journalism. From 2004 to 2012, 16 South African journalists were awarded the Rosalynn Carter Center Mental Health Journalism Fellowships. Based on these fellowships offered by the Carter Center in Atlanta, USA, the Cipla Mental Health Journalism Awards require the entrants to submit a proposed project with the objective of increasing knowledge and helping to break the stigma associated with mental health. Paul Miller, CEO of Cipla South Africa, says: "Over the past couple of years, Cipla has been working to shift the narrative from mental illness to mental health and break the stigma so that people can realise that there is help and there is hope.  Mental health and the issues surrounding it are still largely misunderstood so there is dire need to educate people about the fact that the brain is also an organ which can become ill. In South Africa, specifically, mental health is not always considered newsworthy, is shrouded in stereotypes, and limited knowledge about the topic means generally only major psychiatric illnesses are placed under the spotlight." The three winners of this Fellowship will each receive a R20,000 cash prize. To enter, visit www.sadag.org for more details. The winners will be announced at the Cipla psychiatric congress in August 2020.
