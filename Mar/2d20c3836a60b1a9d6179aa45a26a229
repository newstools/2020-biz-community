Users can access this data using AU’s MapMyRun app.Rush: UA’s Rush line of apparel is made from special fabric infused with 13 minerals (created in collaboration with Celliant), which recycles the body’s energy during performance. The intention is to provide the same benefits as an infrared sauna.The Rush technology captures the heat energy released from the body, recycles it and returns it to the body. This recycled energy is said to increase temporary localised circulation, promoting improved strength and endurance, and powering tires muscles. In 2020, UA is introducing Rush Seamless, a line of garments that are form fitting but with fewer seams to improve breathability.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/542330.jpg" alt="Under Armour reveals its vision for sportswear in 2020" width="600" height="375">Recovery: UA claims the bioceramic pattern printed on the inside of its Athlete Recovery apparel uses the body’s energy to increase the amount of oxygen reaching the muscles, helping to restore them faster. In addition to faster recovery, the technology is said to promote better sleep, reduce inflammation and regulate metabolism. UA’s Recovery apparel is made using super soft materials for maximum comfort, and is available in Sleep, Travel and Compression collections.Infinity Bra: This one-piece, injection-moulded sports bra is described as UA’s fastest-drying yet.

UA created a responsive textile that’s embedded with quiospheres, which it says are essentially encapsulated moisturisers that activate as soon as the leggings are put on.UA claims this is all thanks to a bacteria called Antarcatine, which produces glycoproteins that help retain water. In a nutshell, the latest iteration of Meridian Leggings combines UA’s softest fabric with moisturiser properties.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/443361-120x120.jpg?1" alt="Designing the future of self-adapting sportswear using bacteria" width="120" height="120">Designing the future of self-adapting sportswear using bacteriaPuma and MIT Design Lab have been collaborating on a research project that looks at how bacteria can be used within sportswear design to improve performance and sustainability...By Lauren Hartzenberg 5 Jun 2018Tribase Reign 2: With greater grip, stability and flexibility, UA’s Tribase gym shoe was designed with high intensity workouts and CrossFit training in mind.
