Image supplied.The annual Media 100 Ranking is produced by combining the results of the industry's most important global and regional media award shows tracked throughout 2019, as determined by the Warc Rankings Advisory Board and a worldwide industry survey.Monty, the World's First AI Predictive Commentator for Foxtel, by Mindshare Sydney, is the most celebrated campaign for media excellence of 2019. Australian pay-TV network Foxtel ran a game-changing campaign to encourage people to pay to watch cricket, a product they had previously enjoyed for free.To deliver more value and transform the viewing experience, Foxtel created Monty, a predictive AI commentator able to forecast when wickets would fall in live games. When Monty predicted a wicket, it triggered mobile display ads, pre-roll video and OOH to get people to watch, delivering an average weekly sales increase of 18%.Katie Rigg-Smith - CEO, Mindshare Australasia, said: As a self-respecting Aussie, I love the cricket and I am thrilled to see Monty not only recognised as best in class but best in the world. It shows the power of provocation, one of our core values at Mindshare. It sees a great consumer insight married with powerful AI that delivered innovation and real outcomes.
