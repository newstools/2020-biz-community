The most sought-after awards would be receiving a whole new look to better reflect dramatic changes occurring in the industry’s skill sets and outcomes and to announce a more glittering, sparkling awards event.As the celebration of the top public relations and communications campaigns enters its 23rd year, the Prism Awards, and Prism Young Voices (PYV) promises a complete face-lift for the entire brand. Frankly, the year 2020 has provided an ideal opportunity to reposition and refresh the reputation of the awards themselves, to provide a more accurate representation of the advances in the PR industry, befitting its contribution to business communications.An exciting but simplified contemporary Prism logo was proposed by Cape Town brand consultants (Off the Shelf Marketing) and was approved by stakeholders at both the Prism Awards and PRISA (Public Relations Institute of South Africa). Like a crystal chandelier, a prism reflects and refracts, adds sparkle and light and it is these integrals that informed the logo, fonts and new motifs which will be gradually introduced at all Prism Awards brand touchpoints.The Prisms are Africa’s most sought-after public relations and communication awards event, judged by over 67 judges alongside 10 dynamic young judges, as part of the PYV initiative. Prisms are awarded to individuals, students, consultancies, companies, government organisations and NGOs that have successfully fused strategy with creativity and professionalism to achieve the best communications and business objectives in their public relations campaigns. The awards are currently in their 23rd year and for 2020, new categories have been introduced.Join us as we celebrate 23 years of South Africa’s PR growth and excellence at this year’s Prism Awards.Date: Sunday, 5 April 2020Venue: The Houghton Hotel, Lloys Ellis Avenue, Houghton EstateTime: 5.30pm for 6pmTo book your seat, go to: www.prism-awards.co.za <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/538403.jpg" alt="Prism Awards entries and Young Voices deadlines extended" width="120" height="120">Prism Awards entries and Young Voices deadlines extendedThe Public Relations Institute of Southern Africa (Prisa) is extending the entry deadlines for Prism Awards and for all aspiring Prism Young Voices applicants...Issued by PRISA 11 Feb 2020
