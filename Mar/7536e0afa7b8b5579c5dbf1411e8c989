One can point to the disastrous interview by Ford SA’s CEO on eNCA Checkpoint on the Kuga fiasco or the Momentum CEO explaining why they repudiated a life cover claim, even though the clients passing has nothing to do with their reasons, as per policy wording. These are just a couple of countless examples where leaders have gotten it wrong. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1709/411959-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ford Kuga - how to get burned a second time on social media" width="120" height="120">Ford Kuga - how to get burned a second time on social mediaIt's surprising how things coincide, isn't it? I was struck a few days ago by a powerful and poignant commercial for eNCA for its TV news...By Brendan Seery 26 Sep 2017Tone and body languageBut let me refer to last month’s interview that trended, to the extent that no one even remembers the actual subject matter of the interview, but rather what went wrong. And the reputation of the individual has taken a knock. You can be sure memes have been created because, in the digital age, there is no escape from your self-inflicted blunders The issue here is not the error of where a certain city in Europe is located (we all make mistakes), but how this was said; the tone and the body language, not forgetting the irritation at the anchor, who was asking questions that we all wanted to know when this particular story broke.The Minister Of Communications Says that she did not go to Switzerland with her husband but she took him to Geneva.

If you cannot give a sound and credible interview when you are being given free publicity, you have failed to establish your share of voice in a narrative you should be driving as far as the brand you manage is concerned. You have missed the opportunity to state your position and market your brand. Most importantly you have failed to educate your audience on the facts so that we don’t get them from a misinformed source.I really hope in #20plenty we change our mindsets when to comes to media training, your reputation depends on it.
