Postponing the event is heart-breaking but we look forward to hosting everyone later this year for our 20th Big Walk anniversary. I am so excited to reveal all the new and exciting elements for our walkers at this year’s event.”East Coast Radio would like to thank KZN for their continued support over the years in participating in The Big Walk. This event is centred around each member of the community.
