<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/541655.png" alt="Castle Lite hides 2020 Unlocks headliner in plain sight!" width="625" height="401">Two weeks ago, the brand set out an extraordinary digital campaign to announce Castle Lite Unlocks 2020, its unique Early Bird ticket system and of course, to reveal the 2020 international headliner – Cardi B. The brand did the unthinkable when it asked its consumers to purchase tickets to the 2020 Unlocks experience before anything had been revealed. All people knew was that tickets were going for a steal at the ice-shattering price of R50. But there had been no mention of the headliner or even what this years’ experience would be.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/539091-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Castle Lite Unlocks early bird tickets go on sale this week" width="120" height="120">Castle Lite Unlocks early bird tickets go on sale this weekEarly bird tickets for the 10th Castle Lite Unlocks will go on sale on Thursday, 20 February 2020 at 3pm...18 Feb 2020The brand left a trail of carefully selected “Easter Eggs” – a trail of clues on the headline act - with the intention of allowing any consumer that paid attention, to break the ice and discover that Cardi B was about to be Unlocked, if you knew where to look of course. This not only saw the #CastleLiteUnlocks hashtag trending and breaking the internet, but it also saw a few people being convinced that they knew who Castle Lite was Unlocking. All of these clues were hidden in plain sight, for anyone to discover who the headliner would be, almost like a virtual Easter Egg hunt.Excitement mounted over the two Easter Eggs that were found and made it pretty obvious that Cardi B would be coming to Mzansi. Tech-savvy consumers looked where no one else was looking and discovered that the words “Castle Lite Unlocks Cardi B" had been added to the Castle Lite website HTML code. What’s more, as speculations were growing online, the brand started telling Friends of Castle Lite who was being Unlocked and caught their reaction on camera. Loyal Cardi B fans were quick to spot the “Bacardi” license plate that was intentionally positioned in the background on Rouge’s video.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/539654-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cardi B announced as headliner of Castle Lite Unlocks 2020" width="120" height="120">Cardi B announced as headliner of Castle Lite Unlocks 2020Castle Lite has revealed that ground-breaking rapper, Cardi B will headline this year's Unlocks experience at the TicketPro Dome in Johannesburg on 12 June 2020...21 Feb 2020What is now very clear is that consumers need to pay careful attention to every move that Castle Lite makes as more and more surprises are in store for this year’s Castle Lite Unlocks experience.
