Instead, the province is more interested in toilet paper.In terms of per city searches, Durban North, Randburg and Roodepoort saw the largest portion of searches for “face masks”.The Dolphin Coast, Pinetown and Westville — all in KwaZulu-Natal — were almost entirely searching for “hand sanitizer”.  trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("GEO_MAP", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"toilet paper","geo":"ZA","time":"now 7-d"},{"keyword":"face masks","geo":"ZA","time":"now 7-d"},{"keyword":"hand sanitizer","geo":"ZA","time":"now 7-d"},{"keyword":"hand wash","geo":"ZA","time":"now 7-d"},{"keyword":"tissues","geo":"ZA","time":"now 7-d"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=now%207-d&geo=ZA&q=toilet%20paper,face%20masks,hand%20sanitizer,hand%20wash,tissues","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"});  Unsurprisingly, searches for “virus”, “COVID 19” and “coronavirus” all spiked this week in South Africa.  trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"virus","geo":"ZA","time":"now 7-d"},{"keyword":"covid 19","geo":"ZA","time":"now 7-d"},{"keyword":"coronavirus","geo":"ZA","time":"now 7-d"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=now%207-d&geo=ZA&q=virus,covid%2019,coronavirus","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"});
