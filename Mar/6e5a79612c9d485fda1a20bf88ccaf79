In addition to this, WorkBook integrates into its finance function and will allow for more robust reporting, forecasting and, therefore, decision-making. “WorkBook is specifically built for agencies and therefore I could immediately see the benefit for our organisation,” said Kruger.CWDi had been using Magnetic for the past five years and needed a solution that would suit its business for the next phase of its growth. Director of agency solutions at Silversoft and CEO at Magnetic, Dan Marcus, says: “We worked extensively with the CWDi team to understand its business growth plans, while planning its transition from Magnetic, and felt that WorkBook was perfectly positioned for the next phase of the business.” About CWDiCWDi is an award-winning brand agency specialising in brand experiences and solving its clients’ business challenges with creative solutions.
