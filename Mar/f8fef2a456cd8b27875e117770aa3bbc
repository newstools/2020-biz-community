DAN SSA believes that during a crisis of this proportion, it’s our humanity that will carry us through.The ad was recorded by Arnold Vermaak and Graham Merrill of WeLove Jam Studios at no cost, while the DAN buying team negotiated free space on regional and national stations. They also collaborated with media owners such as Mediamark, Primedia and the SABC who contributed free airtime and a platform for this important message. Belinda Abraham, Communications, Resource Development & Education Manager for Cape of Good Hope SPCA said: “We are so thankful to the Dentsu Aegis Network for their care and concern for animals at a time when most are only concerned with their own welfare and the welfare of their families. While Covid-19 does not infect animals the ripple effect of the pandemic is already being felt nation-wide as many surrender pets in the fear of virus transmission or abandon them as they leave for homes in other provinces.  We are grateful to the media owners who have come forward to offer our animals a voice via their media and broadcast platforms and thank them for amplifying our voice and speaking on behalf of animals at this time. A great deal of peace comes amidst the panic, knowing that so many hearts are with the vulnerable.”
