1000 Drawings is an art-for-charity initiative in which ordinary citizens create artworks in an A5 format. These may be doodles, sketches, paintings, photographs, etchings, embroidery – any kind of art as long as it’s A5.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/541831-625x416.jpg" alt="What to expect from this year's Night of a 1000 Drawings" width="625" height="416">Previous years have been an epic success with R150,000 raised for the beneficiaries.  The charities benefitting from the generosity are Dlala Nje, Everybody Love Everybody (ELE), Timbuktu in the Valley and not forgetting the original beneficiary, the one who inspired the beginning of 1000 Drawings, Paballo Ya Batho.This year, in addition to the public submissions, the participation has been extended to professional artists, advertising and marketing fraternity, school art departments, art schools, art galleries, tattoo artists and corporate South Africa.Art and charityFriday will kick off with the launch of Art Battle SA. This official Art Battle SA event will see 16 local artists step up to the easel to compete against the clock and for audience votes. Across three 20-minute rounds, the audience will decide which four competitors will join the final round, where only one ‘Art Battle Champion’ will emerge. This champion will join the SA National Tournament series and have a chance to head to the Art Battle World Championships in October 2020.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/541832-625x416.jpg" alt="What to expect from this year's Night of a 1000 Drawings" width="625" height="416">Art Battle is a global live art tournament.

Drop-off boxes for artwork are located around Joburg, encouraging people to doodle and drop-off as much as possible. We also encourage artwork to be sent to us from anywhere in the world/South Africa too – the more we have, the more we raise.”Tickets to the event are available on Webtickets for R100 per person and R50 for students and pensioners with a weekend pass at R280 and doors will open at 4pm on Friday and 10am Saturday and Sunday.
