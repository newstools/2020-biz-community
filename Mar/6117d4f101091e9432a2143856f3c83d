Live DJs slinging beats and drinks kept customers refreshed throughout, and drew foot traffic into the stores. Each event was amplified by micro-influencers who dropped by the store during the week leading up to #DieselDenimFridays as well as on the day. These included @SvaBayi in Durban, @Leago_scars in Johannesburg and @Brian_nzilane in Pretoria while DJs in Menlyn included Oscar Mbo and Malankane.
