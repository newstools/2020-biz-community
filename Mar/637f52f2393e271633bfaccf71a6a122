It forecast that NLU would be essential in providing a seamless retail experience for users and to establish chatbots as a reliable retail channel as it enables chatbots to efficiently process human inputs and produce more accurate automated responses to users.Driven by omnichannel retail strategiesThe new report forecasts that advances in NLU capabilities will drive the effectiveness of chatbots. It anticipates that over 50% of retail chatbot interactions will be completed successfully by 2024, without the need for human intervention. As a result, retailers are urged to implement chatbots as part of a wider omnichannel retail strategy in order to maximise their presence on a number of key retail channels.Additionally, it was found that 80% of global consumer spend over chatbots will be attributable to discrete chatbots by 2024. These are embedded directly into a retailerâ€™s mobile app, rather than accessed via a browser or messaging application. The research anticipates that control over development and the ability to retain company branding will drive discrete chatbots to become the most popular chatbot medium in retail. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517956-120x120.jpg?3" alt="SA brands missing out on R34bn in e-commerce revenue" width="120" height="120">SA brands missing out on R34bn in e-commerce revenueBy 2021, over 20-million South Africans will shop online.
