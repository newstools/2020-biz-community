While this pales in comparison to the cases reported in the hardest-hit countries, it's evident that we are only at the beginning stages of this pandemic and things are likely to get worse before they get better.Out of an abundance of caution I have been working from home for the past week and this has not been its challenges. As a brand communicator, I am used to having people around me as we build ideas through collaboration with a collective, not through isolation. Not being able to engage with my teams and clients face to face on a daily has been a rather painful experience for me. This coupled with a slew of campaign postponements and cancellations that have left the future looking rather uncertain.While we navigate this new normal, I have realised that this crisis has forced us to be a lot more creative. From how we choose to connect with colleagues on a day to day whether it's through Zoom, BlueJeans, and Whatsapp groups. Or how we reshape campaigns for clients through the innovative use of platforms that don't require us to be together. As the old showbiz saying goes, "the show must go on" and for certain artists, brands, awards, and organisations, it certainly has. Here are some insanely creative highlights that are inspiring me to keep the show going:#OnlineQuarantinePartyIf you weren't living under a rock this past weekend you probably heard about the #OnlineQuarantineParty. Artists have been amongst the hardest hit during the Covid-19 crisis, with many seeing their bookings dry up as major events are cancelled. This hasn't dampened their spirits though and the #OnlineQuarantineParty hosted by DJ Shimza is an exciting initiative that promises to keep Mzansi entertained! The party was streamed on live on Facebook from Shimza's home studio and featured a lineup of some of South Africa's biggest artists including Scorpion Kings DJ Maphorisa and Kabza De Small,Black Motion, DJ Zihle and Shimza. Major brands like MTV Base also jumped onto the party streamed it to their audience of 6 million on Facebook.#QuarantineOnlineParty https://t.co/beNmWJNoVE— SHIMZA (@Shimza01) March 21, 2020 Bookmark Awards go digitalOne of the most prestigious awards for digital marketers in South Africa digitised their Annual Bookmark Awards ceremony. The Bookmarks are usually a glamorous affair celebrating the country's most digitally savvy marketers however this year IAB SA, the award's organisers, were forced to cancel to minimise the health risk to attendees.
