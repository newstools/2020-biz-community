Makro said it is now enforcing customer purchasing limits, while Woolworths has set a limit of 5 units per product per customer on certain items.“We are very mindful that stockpiling could hurt the most vulnerable consumers in our society who don’t have the discretionary income to make large purchases,” said Makro in a statement. Pick n Pay said that customers have been buying responsibly “for the most part”, but in cases where stocks are temporarily low due to heavy customer demand, the retailer will be limiting the number of certain products per customer.  As a fresh produce retailer primarily, Food Lover’s Market told Bizcommunity that it has not suffered any stock shortages as yet, but CEO Brian Coppin urged consumers to shop mindfully. “Please consider carefully what you need and buy in a manner that does not leave others without much-needed items. Remember, if we all shop as we normally would, we will ensure that there is enough availability for everyone,” he said.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/543295-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Pick n Pay introduces special shopping hour for pensioners" width="120" height="120">Pick n Pay introduces special shopping hour for pensionersPick n Pay will open all its supermarkets and hypermarkets an hour earlier every Wednesday for the exclusive use of elderly customers who need to shop for their groceries...1 day agoThe Shoprite Group has limited orders via its recently-launched Checkers Sixty60 to a maximum of 30 items and individual products are limited to three per customer to facilitate quicker fulfillment of orders."We understand consumers' concerns but appeal to them to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the items they need.
