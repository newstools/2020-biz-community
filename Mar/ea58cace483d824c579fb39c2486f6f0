To curb stockpiling, Pick n Pay has limited purchases on specific products per customer in store and online.“There is enough food in the supply chain, and we ask customers to support us by not stocking up beyond what they need. Our stores will remain open, safe and well-stocked for our customers during this time so that they can continue to get what they want and need,” says John Bradshaw, retail executive: marketing at Pick n Pay. “Our staff are working really hard to keep our stores clean and our shelves stocked. We are giving them every support, and ask all our customers to do the same. We are all in this together.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/543647-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Covid-19: SA supermarkets appeal to shoppers to quit panic buying" width="120" height="120">Covid-19: SA supermarkets appeal to shoppers to quit panic buyingRetailers have attempted to quell fears surrounding stock shortages as footage of panic buyers and empty supermarket shelves filter through social media...By Lauren Hartzenberg 19 Mar 2020Pick n Pay's CEO Richard Brasher also appears in a video posted on the retailer's social media pages this week, in which he assures customers that the company is working hard to enforce stringent hygiene protocols and to keep a steady supply of food and household essentials on shelves.
