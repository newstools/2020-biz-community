In addition to sharing news, statistics, and articles on the treatment and management of the disease, it will also aim to bust myths around coronavirus.   ANA hopes that in collating and curating this information and making it accessible to everyone, it can spread a little kindness, compassion, as well as the truth.  “There are many unknowns about this disease and many mistruths, half-truths and false information that are being circulated.  This can have the effect of creating panic and fear.  In providing this free access to credible knowledge, we aim to empower people and assist the public in not feeling so scared or alone during these current unsettling times,” said Lance Witten, chief content officer: ANA Syndication. Covid-19 content can be accessed here.  ANA’s team of journalists and multimedia content producers will be working around the clock to keep the coronavirus content current.
