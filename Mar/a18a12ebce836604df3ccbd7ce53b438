ECR has taught me everything that I know, however it is time for me to move on now. I am really excited for the unknown, I’m up for the challenge and just curious to see what my future holds. There may be a move to a different city in the pipeline as well, so a lot of change but good change and I’m excited for it,” said Mtolo.Mtolo who is well- known for his Spontaneous and edgy opinions started his journey with radio ten years ago where he was a technical producer at East Coast Radio. He was then given the opportunity to host his first ever show; late night weekends with Bongani Mtolo between 12-3am. He then moved to hosting Early Morning Weekends between 3- 6am where he was promoted to waking-up KZN by hosting the Early Breakfast Show on Weekdays between 4-6am.
