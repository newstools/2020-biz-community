Discussions on issues of gender-based violence (GBV) have come to the fore across social media and traditional platforms globally. The commercial follows the life of a woman who is subjected to different barriers throughout her day, from the time she travels to work by taxi fearing harassment to possible abuse at home. She proves herself in the boardroom and endured catcalls in the streets which add challenges to her days highlighting how society should collaborate to positively change our communities. All these challenges are starkly put on the spotlight throughout the ad. When women still live in fear, feel marginalised and have to keep their lips sealed for fear of abuse, should we not rewrite the rules?
