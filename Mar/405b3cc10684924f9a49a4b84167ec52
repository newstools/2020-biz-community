Forrester estimated that Chinese consumers spent $104.44bn on luxury in 2019, or one-third of global luxury retail sales. At the outset of the outbreak, many luxury brands temporarily closed some of their retail stores or shortened operating hours and halted marketing spending in China altogether. However, leading luxury brands are gaining brand affinity by supporting the cause of combating the Covid-19 outbreak:Leading luxury groups expressed their caring via donations: On 27 January, LVMH announced that it had given $2.2 million to the Red Cross Society of China. Days later, Richemont donated $1.4 million to the same cause and Kering donated $1.1 million.On 18 February, Louis Vuitton launched a cause marketing campaign, 'Love has no fear', on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Multiple Chinese celebrity brand ambassadors recorded videos to encourage residents in Wuhan and support frontline medical workers. The campaign topic generated 4.2 billion views within its first week.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/542942-120x120.jpg?2" alt="LVMH makes free sanitiser for French hospitals during Covid-19 outbreak" width="120" height="120">LVMH makes free sanitiser for French hospitals during Covid-19 outbreakLVMH will begin producing hand disinfectant gel at three factories belonging to its perfume and cosmetics unit, for distribution to French hospitals...1 day agoBest practice no. 2: Sustain business by moving events and sales onlineMajor luxury brands regularly engage with empowered Chinese consumers across top digital marketing and commerce platforms such as JD’s TopLife, Tmall Luxury Pavilion, WeChat and Weibo.
