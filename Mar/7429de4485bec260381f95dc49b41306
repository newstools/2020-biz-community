In this area, 7 out of 10 respondents are relying on input from partners, especially advertising agencies, to whom they outsource the service. However, marketers who address creativity internally, state that they do so because they know the market, brand and consumers better than agencies do.The 'ideal' agencyThe most mentioned qualities by advertisers when it comes to defining the ‘ideal’ creative agency, regardless of the type of agency, and whether they work with them now or in the future are creativity/innovative ideas, account service, knowledge of the market/client/brand and digital capabilities.Pitching is the most frequently used agency selection method by marketersThe most frequently used agency selection method in South Africa is pitching (both strategic and creative), which accounts for 83% of cases. Other common methods used by marketers in the agency selection process are trial assignments (34%) and workshops (26%). Only 25% of marketers state that they always remunerate agencies that participate in pitches. In addition, more than half of the marketers state that their procurement departments are involved in the negotiation processes with agencies.High levels of satisfactionMarketing professionals in South Africa work with, on average, 3.1 creative agencies and 1 media agency with which they maintain an average relationship of 4.5 years with the former (a slight increase on the 4.3 years declared in the second edition of the study in 2017) and 4.7 with the latter.Levels of both recommendation (7.2 points on a scale of 0-9) and satisfaction (77.4% of marketers are satisfied with their agencies work) are high, and the percentage of marketers who declare having an intention of changing agencies has decreased (17.7 in 2019 vs 19.5 in 2017), with bad account services being the main reason to change.The percentage of the contribution of agencies to the growth of marketers’ business for whom they work, according to their opinion, has increased in the last two years, being 20% for creative agencies (17% in 2017) and 18% (14% in 2017) for media agencies.
