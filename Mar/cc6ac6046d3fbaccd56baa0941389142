Winners of the prestigious award are expected to showcase unconventional and new approaches to digital marketing that demonstrate robust, measurable results.Qualifying as a finalist for the year after winning the Markie Award is a feat in itself, but international renown and recognition in the marketing space is something new for Spur Steak Ranches – another client of Engagement Factory that has qualified for the Oracle Markie Awards.“We’ve worked hard to get to this point by investing in both our people and unproven technology within a South African context,” says Sacha Du Plessis, chief marketing officer of Spur. “Our new approach could have yielded the same results we have always expected – but we are achieving extraordinary results with this completely new MA platform, and we’re excited to be recognised for it by Oracle.” Through innovative use of an Eloqua plugin by Engagement Factory known as Dynamo, Spur Steak Ranches was able to leverage its audience and approach them in new and interesting ways. Furthermore, it was able to take those results and replicate them on unknown audiences with similar behaviour patterns and traits to great success. “We are exceedingly proud of our South African origin and heritage, and it’s great for the team to be recognised by such a prestigious organisation and the international community,” concludes Du Plessis.Engagement Factory assisted and guided the marketing strategy and campaigns of both companies. Through technology, processes, data and specialised tools, it was able to support both Bonnier and Spur achieve a finalist position for the 2020 Markie Awards. The news of their qualification made Jos Caelers, CEO of Engagement Factory, proud. “These guys are the leaders, the innovators, the pioneers, the change-makers – simply the best of the best,” Caelers said. “They have exceeded expectations and gone beyond what marketers would consider common wisdom. Today, we ask you to share in and celebrate their success.”The winners of the 2020 Markie Awards are expected to be announced on 20 March.Engagement FactoryEstablished in 2012, Engagement Factory services businesses around the world through six offices over three continents.
