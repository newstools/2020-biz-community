The VDX.tv product suite incorporates existing solutions, as well as new technologies developed for Advanced TV. By 2021, 82% of all consumer internet traffic will be video, according to Cisco. Brands must adapt their advertising strategies accordingly. VDX.tv makes it simple for brands to create personalised video-driven experiences across channels and screens, from mobile devices and laptops to CTV/OTT. VDX.tv’s COO Scott Kellstedt explains VDX.tv is designed with its customers’ evolving needs in mind. “As in the US, brands throughout Canada, Europe and Asia are adopting cross-channel, digital video strategies. According to IAB research, more than eight in 10 advertisers believe a unified multi-platform buying solution (TV + digital video) is important. Adding CTV into the product mix helps close the loop for the growing number of brands looking to execute an all-screens approach.”Kellstedt adds that what really sets VDX.tv apart is its ability to deliver tailormade-solutions. “Video is of universal value to the market, but brands across categories have different objectives and concerns. Audience behaviour also varies depending on the vertical, the size of the purchase, and the prospect’s position in the consideration journey. Our solution allows brands to complement their TV buys and amplify their video messaging, reaching their most relevant consumers.” As of 9 March 2020, VDX.tv solutions are available in APAC regions, Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as EMEA regions Spain, France, Netherlands, United Kingdom, South Africa and Dubai and Canada.About VDX.tvVDX.tv is a global advertising technology company that is transforming the way brands connect with relevant audiences in today’s converging video landscape.
