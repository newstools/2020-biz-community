As an example, Pura has launched an alternative carbonated soft drinks product range with exotic flavours such as juniper, cranberry, cucumber and lime and Seville orange, amongst others. In line with the global trend, the popularity of craft tonic water has grown significantly, primarily driven by the booming South African craft gin market. This has become increasingly popular amongst consumers in pubs, clubs and at home. It appears that gin is not a passing fad, and is still trending in South Africa, with players introducing local gin ranges infused with fynbos botanicals.Fitch & Leedes have launched a variety of flavoured tonic water variants such as Blue Tonic, Grapefruit Tonic and Pink Tonic. The combination of these flavoured tonic waters and gin has created a new trend where brands are emphasising cocktail recipes, pairing suggestions and mixology ideas for consumers. Fever-Tree has also recently launched its premium mixer range into the South African market.Other manufacturers, for example, Barker and Quin, currently offer exotic flavours as part of its existing Finest Indian Tonic Water product range, with ingredients that include natural quinine, citrus fruit extracts and Indian spices such as cardamom and star anise.Given the capricious nature of consumers (especially the millennial segment), it is becoming crucial for key market players to stay abreast of the latest developments within the industry to ensure they meet the fluid needs of consumers.The South African Carbonated Soft Drinks Industry Landscape Report 2020 (119 pages) provides a dynamic synthesis of industry research, examining the local and global carbonated soft drinks industry from a uniquely holistic perspective, with detailed insights into the entire value chain – from global and local trends to manufacturing, retailing and pricing.
