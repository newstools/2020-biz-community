The first case of Covid-19, the novel coronavirus, was identified in China on 17 November 2019. In just four months, the marketplace has shifted dramatically.  The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 and President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that South Africa will go into lockdown after Thursday, 26 March. As humans, Covid-19 is affecting every sphere of life – from the products we consume, to how we shop, work and socialise, to our enduring attitudes to life. This is likely to be a watershed moment that will change behaviour not just during the crisis, but in the ‘new normal’ to follow.
