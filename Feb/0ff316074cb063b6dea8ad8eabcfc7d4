With international headquarters in the UK, React Group is represented in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth by React Customer Research SA. At the upcoming Cape Town event, guests can find out how the latest customer research and mystery shopping strategies can ensure an efficient, adaptable response to changing market conditions and shoppers’ needs, trends and choices. Jill Spencer describes, as an example, how Broadgate, the largest pedestrianised neighbourhood in Central London, increased footfall to some 64,000 visits per day with the insight and advice from data sourced through ReactCX’s mystery shopping programme.   Grant Lindhorst, managing director of React Customer Research SA, says:“Many businesses in South Africa struggle to retain customers, let alone win new ones in these tough trading conditions. They need proven methods to make their services more competitive and attractive to the needs of the customer. “At the workshop, you can find out how to measure and then boost customer experience and the effectiveness of your marketing and promotions. The goal is to earn a reputation for great service by well-trained staff and more effective in-store and online systems and processes to make buying from you as easy and pleasurable as possible.”Customer experience is now the key battleground for consumers’ purses and wallets, says Jill Spencer: “89% of companies surveyed by leading analyst Gartner said that customer experience will be their primary basis for competitive differentiation. The winners will out-sell their competitors, increase profits and retain customers.”For more information: www.react.co.za Jill Spencer is associate director at ReactCX, based in the UK.
