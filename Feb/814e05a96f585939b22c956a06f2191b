Fortunately, South Africa is blessed with countless shopping centres and retail stores that cater to virtually any customer.This is where Smart Media comes in. We bring our expertise with in-store branding to ensure that the products or services of our customers have a presence directly where shoppers are making purchasing decisions,” says Mark Uria, CEO Smart Media.Smart Media has 360° advertising offerings that do not waste marketing space. Before a customer even enters a shop, there is already a direct line of sight of a product through a layered, 3D high-impact window advertising displays known as Smart windows. These are no ordinary window dressings but designed to create a bold brand presence, exude professionalism and deliver the right message at the right time.The next points of contact are the barrier sleeves over the security scanners – which consumers pass upon entering and exiting the store. And when they take a basket or trolley, the Smart Media mobile offering comes into play providing messaging on the basket and trolley. This impacts not only the person with the basket or trolley but also consumers passing by.And when it comes to its partnership with Dis-Chem, Smart Media can also leverage the dispensary section as a brand-building opportunity.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/451363-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Driving the retail brand experience through in-store media" width="120" height="120">Driving the retail brand experience through in-store mediaIn the highly competitive environment of in-store advertising, brands are contesting limited market share.
