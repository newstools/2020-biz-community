The integration of print and digital. I believe there should be no division between print and digital. I believe they are one. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you currently reading/watching/listening to for work? In 2019 I had limited time to read.

I carry two mobile phones. One is my favourite phone – a Nokia 3310 which is a feature phone. It’s my preferred phone over the always-connected smartphone, because I believe as human beings we need time to disconnect and reflect. This mobile phone allows me to ignore the noise and focus on what matters, especially when I need to focus on work.For more info, visit FastCompany.co.za or follow the magazine on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and/or LinkedIn.
