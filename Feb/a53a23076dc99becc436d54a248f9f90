Once it ran, millions of people joined this national effort.” Like the first full-page ad, Sunday’s ad is a call to action to millions to unite to tackle environmental degradation and the climate crisis of today.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/536648.jpg" alt="Full-page ad in The New York Times in 2020" width="625" height="1116" rel="">Full-page ad in The New York Times in 2020click to enlarge“For the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, we need everyone participating,” says Kathleen Rogers, Earth Day Network president. “The first Earth Day led to the creation of the EPA, Clean Air Amendments, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act, and many of our nation’s most important environmental legislation, all passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. In 1970, Earth Day mobilised 20 million Americans. Today, Earth Day is global, and every nation on Earth is participating.” Earth Day Network is a non-profit organisation with a mission to diversify, educate and activate the environmental movement worldwide. Growing out of the first Earth Day, Earth Day Network is the world’s largest recruiter to the environmental movement, working with 75,000 partners in nearly 192 countries.
