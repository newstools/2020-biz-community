I think that it is time that that stops today… Through my win, I hope I have inspired people, even if just one person, to be themselves at all times and to never compromise their identities, and to insert themselves in spaces where they feel that people like them do not belong.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/530942-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: ." width="120" height="120">How the media is reacting to Zozibini Tunzi Meltwater tracked and analysed conversations surrounding the Zozibini Tunzi winning the Miss Universe pageant...10 Dec 2019Determined to dispel the myth that beauty queens have no depth, Tunzi is using her platform to change the narrative around gender-based violence.

Rebecca Davis wrote on the Daily Maverick, “How Miss Universe and Mr Springbok saved the night at stormy Sona”, highlighting the impact of Tunzi and Siya Kolisi’s star power to soothe ruffled feathers after a very disruptive beginning to the evening, that resulted in a 90-minute delay before we first heard from President Ramaphosa.Davis writes:As the two took turns to stand and wave to the House, a ripple of admiration and the most sincere applause of the night followed. Suddenly, everything seemed calm and under control once again.Indeed, “the luminescence of Miss Universe and the Springbok hero”, turned attendees’ attention from rehashing the past to instead focusing on what can be done to improve the future.

It has been a truly united and determined response from all South Africans. Through building social compacts across society to fight this scourge we will be able to achieve much more. But it is only the beginning of the struggle. We implemented an emergency action plan and reprioritised R1.6bn to support this plan until the end of the current financial year. There has been progress in several areas. We will amend the Domestic Violence Act to better protect victims in violent domestic relationships and the Sexual Offences Act to broaden the categories of sex offenders whose names must be included in the National Register for Sex Offenders, and we will pass a law to tighten bail and sentencing condition in cases that involve gender-based violence. The empowerment of women is critical to inclusive economic growth. We are introducing the SheTradesZA platform to assist women-owned businesses to participate in global value chains and markets. Over the next five years, the Industrial Development Corporation is targeting R10bn of own and partner funding for women-empowered businesses. To create a larger market for small businesses, we plan to designate 1,000 locally produced products that must be procured from SMMEs.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1802/430130-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#MarchforChange meme from ." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: #Sona2018 leaves SA's social media set hopeful of real changeThe recent State of the Nation Address, given just a day after coming to power by newly minted president Cyril Ramaphosa, left many SA netizens satisfied and optimistic about the future as he promised one where hard work would triumph over past inequalities...By Leigh Andrews 26 Feb 2018Taking the sentiment from country to the continentPresident Ramaphosa has also just returned from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, where South Africa assumed the chairship of the African Union for 2020.

Yvonne Wakefield, founder of The Warrior Project, an online portal with information and resources for victims of domestic and gender-based violence, says it was disappointing that Sona lacked specific detail on progress achieved with the R1.6bn in allegedly allocated funds or plans going forward to turn the tide against such violence and femicide. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/510351-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Becca Tapert on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Yvonne Wakefield launches The Warrior Project to help domestic abuse, gender-based violence victimsAlongside Jackie Nagtegaal of LawForAll and Aisha Pandor of SweepSouth, Caveat Legal founder Yvonne Wakefield launched The Warrior Project at the start of Women's Month...6 Aug 2019Wakefield says all eyes are now on the Finance Minister for a precise report in the Budget Speech.Wakefield concluded:Words give us hope but they are just words.
