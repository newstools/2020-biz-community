This year was extra special as Women’s Health launched an #FNO charity drive to collect previously loved fitness gear to benefit women from underprivileged communities.“We believe that fitness should be accessible to all South Africans. But the reality is that, while you can work out anywhere at any time, not everyone can afford quality fitness gear. So, in partnership with adidas, we launched the Fit Night Out charity drive. We asked women to bring their pre-loved fitness gear and trainers along and, in exchange for their donations, they received access to the adidas style bar, where they were treated by the style team. The response was fantastic – and the fitness gear collected will be distributed in underprivileged communities in partnership with the organisation It’s Your Turn and former WH Next Fitness Star and adidas ambassador Mapule Ndhlovu’s foundation.” – Danielle Weakley, WH editorEnergetic workoutsThe workouts kicked off with a strong warm-up by Lushwill Rossouw (@lushwill) from CrossFit District Six (@crossfitdistrict6), who showed the crowd exactly how to get their muscles ready for the workouts to come. Fitness sensation, Mapule Ndhlovu (@queenfitnass), then got the crowd pumped with her mischievous mix of high kicks, tuck jumps and happy moves, before Women’s Health Next Fitness Star 2019, Nomawothi Bafana (@_melaninfit_), demonstrated some easy-to-follow bootcamp-inspired moves. The night hit a new high as Toka Lintsa (@toka_lintsa) led an afro-dance fitness session, which formed a sleek transition into the retro studio set from the Virgin Active SA team, led by Ceri Hannan (Ceri.Hannan), that had the crowd engaged and nostalgic all at the same time. To end the night, the Cape Town-based team from SWEAT 1000 (@sweat_1000) led a massive finale that left everyone drenched and riding high on endorphins. Of course, all the workouts were accompanied by DJ Junglegum (@Junglegum_ct) on the decks, who kept the crowd hopping to the beats and leading the crowds was MC Rori Thandekiso (@rorisangt)  who’s insanely inspirational take on body positivity and inclusivity is all that Women’s Health stands for – fit, healthy bodies for life. ActivationsHeadline partner, adidas set up the adidas style bar, where those who donated their pre-loved gear could get their hair braided, make-up glittered or nails stencilled by the style team. Official hydration partner Powerade kept the crowd liquid throughout the day with an endless supply of ice-cold refreshment and, during the breaks, there were plenty of sponsor activations to explore, including Mitchum’s refresher station and Fry’s Family Foods’ delicious vegan burger stand.
