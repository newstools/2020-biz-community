Very easy,” Oshotse tells Africa Renewal in an interview.Online shopping for goods and services is booming in Africa and it’s changing the very nature of many startups, especially among young entrepreneurs.With the emergence of online technologies, Africa is joining the burgeoning world of digital economies. Estimates suggest about 264 e-commerce startups are operational across the continent, active in at least 23 countries. There’s significant potential to create new jobs – as many as 3 million by 2025. These jobs will be directly in online marketplaces, supporting services and spin-off economic activity.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/489417-120x120.jpg?2" alt="African retailers have the opportunity to re-imagine a data-driven sector" width="120" height="120">African retailers have the opportunity to re-imagine a data-driven sectorTransforming retail starts with the business model, not the technology...By Toros Esim 27 Mar 2019Benefits will include opening markets to otherwise isolated rural communities and servicing Africa’s fast-growing consumer class. Young entrepreneurs are taking a keen interest in e-commerce because it entails reasonable startup funding, offers revenue-generating prospects, and has an open door to all, in ways traditional workplaces may not. African e-commerce can be a force for sustainable development.The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates that Africa had at least 21 million online shoppers in 2017, 50% of which were in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya. Although this is only a small portion of the African population which is over a billion, the number has been increasing by 18% annually since 2014, which is 6% higher than the world average.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/534615-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#BizTrends2020: Using e-commerce tools to build disruptive consumer brands" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2020: Using e-commerce tools to build disruptive consumer brandsMany disruptive consumer brands eventually expand into retailers in order to reach broader scale, and fast-moving retailers can accelerate this process...By Paul Cook 16 Jan 2020Challenges and the opportunity in continental tradeDespite the growing popularity of e-commerce in Africa, the industry faces obstacles.The E-commerce Index 2018 by UNCTAD measures an economy’s preparedness to support online shopping covers 151 world economies, including 44 African countries. Mauritius was ranked 55th, the highest among African countries. Nigeria and South Africa ranked 75 and 77 respectively. Nine of the last ten countries in the ranking are African.Challenges include slow and expensive internet connectivity, inadequate infrastructure and weak delivery logistics. Consumer protections are weak or non-existent, affecting trust between the seller and the buyer.While mobile payment is growing, cash-on-delivery remains popular in Africa, making cross-border e-commerce difficult. Also, policies are often not adapted to complex payment supply chains, meaning Africa’s merchants have fewer options to connect their local e-payments systems with services used by global customers.Policy-makers also need to work to improve local and global payment system interoperability. This would help bolster Africa’s position as a global leader in mobile payments.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/534459-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Zak Sivalingum; FNB regional director: Gauteng East" width="120" height="120">One Africa: Businesses need to drive the AfCFTAThe African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is the subject of much excitement and debate at the moment. All but one of the 55 countries making up the continent have signed the agreement...By Zak Sivalingum 15 Jan 2020The new Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is a gamechanger. Set to start trading in 2020, the AfCFTA aims to create the world’s largest trading bloc, with a market of 1.27 billion consumers, expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Bridging the digital divide and creating an enabling environment would help entrepreneurs like Catherine Oshotse grow their clientele even further and offers vast opportunities for innovation.The role e-commerce can play in realising the AfCFTA is also critical. “E-commerce has the potential to lift intra-African trade from the current rate of 18% and to boost Africa’s share of global trade, currently estimated at less than 3%,” said Ajay Kumar Bramdeo, the African Union’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, during E-commerce Week in Geneva in 2019.
