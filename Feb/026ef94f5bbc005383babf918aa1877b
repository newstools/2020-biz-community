Which is explaining how you are creating value over time.For an integrated report to have heart it must tell a holistic story of the business. Guiding principles pave the way for the preparation, content and presentation, but are only that, a guide.

It will show and the connection will be lost.Be critical of last year’s reportAsk the right questions, get it assessed independently and listen to the feedback. Have a themeNot a vision, a theme. Something to hook your capitals, your story and your vision on.Tell a story and keep it shortA good editor will see the bigger picture and take out what isn’t necessary. Make it outcome-basedIt’s not all about the figures but how you’ve affected people. But the biggest factor that will help you connect with your stakeholder is true integration. When you can substantiate your position with real cohesion between capitals, the reason why you’re in business becomes the story and reporting becomes secondary."There has always been a symphony of these sources of value creation because of their interconnection and interdependency together with the relationships between the company and its stakeholders” – Dr Mervyn King.Blue Apple runs Integrated Reporting workshops to help you through the process and have been designing, editing and project-managing reports for 20 years.
