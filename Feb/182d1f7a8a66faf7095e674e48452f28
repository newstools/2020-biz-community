The study also found that over 60% of buyers and exhibitors continue to find face-to-face connections the most effective way to conduct business, followed by email (32%) and phone call (4%). Interestingly, when asked about the rise of digital in the industry, the two biggest concerns lay in losing touch with human relationships (48%), followed by online communities replacing physical communities (26%). Matt Pearce, CEO of Talk2 Media & Events says: "This industry report provides real insight into what makes delegates tick – and is another way we’re continuing to listen to the community. At AIME 2020, expect to be challenged both professionally and personally. We have sharpened our focus on creating more meaningful and human moments, with greater opportunities to drive positive business results."Furthermore, it was also revealed that the Asia Pacific region was critical (34%) to driving business growth, with 42% stating that the region had significant influence and only 16% stating it had partial influence. When it came to the best time to place business, 37% of buyers and exhibitors stated the first quarter (Jan–Mar) was most important, followed by 23% for the third quarter (July–September), 25% for the second (April–Jun) and 15% for the fourth (October–December). AIME takes place from 17–19 February 2020 in Melbourne.
