It takes so long that the man of the house returns years later to find someone else in his place and his child not recognising him. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/492513-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screen grab from the ad." width="120" height="120">#OrchidsandOnions: Thanks for the laugh, OgilvyHow difficult is it, Google and Sportsman's Warehouse, to divine that I could get actively annoyed by ads for something I've already bought?By Brendan Seery 16 Apr 2019The latest ads are not quite so cynically funny but they do take what the ad agency, Ogilvy Cape Town, calls a “harmless jab” at the current generation’s obsession with celebs, “stuff” and, most importantly, fomo (fear of missing out). The vague, nagging feeling that there is a hole in your life affects the great and the good, too, as Gumtree illustrates in two vignettes. First up is a man called Cyril. Clearly very important, he sits by the fire with a decanter of the finest whisky, reading (heavens!) a print newspaper to keep up with the events of the world. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/537120.jpg" alt="Robin Adams and Ogilvy Cape Town living 'The Life'!" width="120" height="120">Robin Adams and Ogilvy Cape Town living 'The Life'!Egg Films's new ad created for Ogilvy Cape Town, 'The Life', takes a harmless jab at the current generation's Insta-Fomo and offers Gumtree as a wallet-friendly solution...Issued by Egg Films 5 Feb 2020But still, something’s not quite right, so he picks up his phone, calls up Gumtree and starts looking for a new computer, all within his “budget”…  Surprise, surprise, it’s not the Cyril, but one Cyril Nkosi who, thanks to Gumtree, can also have a state of “The Life”. Then we see Kim and Kanye, an ultra sexy and hip couple, relaxing at home on their comfy couch, he with virtual reality goggles on his head, she with her nose buried in her smartphone. We learn that all the “stuff” around them has come from Gumtree – couch, bicycle, even baby pram – and Kim is still clearly concerned there is something out there (on Gumtree) with her name on it, so she surfs and surfs… As before, we discover that these two are not, in fact, the Kardashians, but just plain Kanye and Kim Kumalo… I like the fact that the ad makers haven’t taken themselves – or the much-adored millennials – too seriously and are confident enough to have that little dig. At the same time, though, it makes the point that you, too, can find what you’re looking for, on Gumtree, from the comfort of your place – whether that be the Union Buildings, Hollywood or just plain Randburg. So Orchids to Ogilvy Cape Town, as well as to Egg Films and director Robin Adams. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/456171-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Adams, soaking up some inspiration." width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with... Robin AdamsThis week, we got behind the selfie with Robin Adams, commercials director at Egg Films...By Leigh Andrews 5 Sep 2018I am anything but a prude but I really have to wonder about people who, in this day and age, still use a bit of sexual innuendo to make a marketing point. An ad for eTravel is one such. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/540024.jpg" alt="The eTravel ad." width="200" height="328">The eTravel ad.The company is aimed at small travel business operators and offers them support they struggle to get, being out on their own. Fair enough. But was it necessary to characterise ‘support’ by using a bra filled with two melons (melons, geddit, bru!) as a way to illustrate this? Maybe you thought it would resonate with your target market – because many of the small travel businesses in this country are run by women. I’ll be the first to admit I am not one of them, but I am fortunate to be married to an intelligent, capable woman and I know she would think this ad silly and sleazy… never mind talking down to “the girls” by using simple, easy-to-understand visuals (everyone’s got a bra, right, bru?) But, mainly, resorting to this sort of back-to-the-60s nudge-nudge, wink-wink sleaze just says one thing: you are bereft of marketing ideas. And, if that is the case, you pick up an Onion.
