The chairperson is voted into this role by the CC exco and performs this role for two years until the process repeats itself. Neo Mashigo from M&C Saatchi Abel has taken over the responsibilities. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1803/433113-120x120.jpg?2" alt="TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris’ CCO Peter Gabriel Khoury, new Creative Circle chairman for 2018/9." width="120" height="120">"Transformation is a layered word that we need to use to its full potential" - new Creative Circle chair, Pete KhouryTBWA\Hunt\Lascaris' CCO 'sweet' Pete Khoury is the Creative Circle chairperson for 2018/9. Here's how he plans to reshape the industry...By Leigh Andrews 15 Mar 2018Khoury had this to say:I would like to thank my fellow exco members for their support and council throughout my term, and to the Loeries team, who helped me every day behind the scenes on every activity. When I look back over the two years, as an exco team we managed to have an influential impact on the industry. We migrated all Creative Circle comms to our back then, non-existent social channels, which keep the industry up to date in real time on all international and local activity that would be of interest to us. We updated and implemented a new CI across all our channels, and we collaborated with the Brand Council to start the Monthly Design Awards, which brings us both closer together, making our industry stronger and more collaborative. We hosted two Full Circle Post Cannes Inspiration Events, which attracted close to one thousand people collectively. We partnered with AAA and the ACA to find and place 20 young writers into bursary programmes which will bear fruit in one and a half years. We also did many inspiration/knowledge-sharing sessions for a variety of marketers, like Investec, RMB, SAB AB InBev and Liberty. I hand over the baton to Neo Mashigo as the new Chairperson. I have full confidence and trust that Neo will take the Creative Circle to even more impactful heights. He has my full support. Lastly, I would like to thank Muriel Brink, our Creative Manager at TBWA\Hunt Lascaris; she was with me in the trenches over the past two years. There was no precedent for a lot of the stuff we had to get on with, and Muriel without hesitation helped me with it all. Muriel, I would never have been able to do this without you. I appreciate and value you very much. And, Ilsa Sonnemann, thank you too for all your effort and help, and for having Muriel’s back.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/529029-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Neo Mashigo, chief creative officer of M&amp;C Saatchi Abel, announced as the FM AdFocus industry leader 2019.
