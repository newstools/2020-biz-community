The WTM Africa team appeals to exhibitors to ensure that they conceptualise, construct, operate and remove their stands with sustainability, top of mind," says Oberholzer. "Fabric graphics that can be reused are encouraged instead of vinyl prints and, where recycling bins are available, we ask everyone who visits the show to use them responsibly and support us in our aim of reducing the impact of the event on the beautiful City of Cape Town. The conference will also see the removal of bags historically distributed to attendees to hold the collateral they receive on the show floor and we appeal to our exhibitors to think sustainably when it comes to their onsite collateral distributed at the show, and where possible share marketing materials with visitors, electronically.Spotlighting responsible tourism valuesOn a macro level, the Africa Responsible Tourism Awards celebrates six years of responsible tourism experiences the African tourism industry in 2020. The awards rest on a simple principle – that all types of tourism, from niche to mainstream, can and should be organised in a way that preserves, respects and benefits destinations and local people. The twenty-twenty awards will be presented to those businesses and organisations which can demonstrate the core responsible tourism values of transparency and respect, which are able to demonstrate their impact and which have, or could, inspire others to achieve more.More information on the awards and entry forms are available on the awards website, with nominations now open. World Travel Market Africa 2020 takes place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre(CTICC) from 6-8 April.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/539587-625x383.jpg" alt="Image Supplied." width="625" height="383">Image Supplied.
