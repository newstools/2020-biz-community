Global interest and participation in One Screen has grown sharply over the years, promoting us to recognise the best of the best by region.He added the body of work submitted illustrates the current mindset and voice of the greater global creative community. “This year’s entries include provocative subject matter that prompts us to think about how we’re progressing as a people, and sparks conversation on how to keep us moving forward in the right direction,” said Jirjis.
