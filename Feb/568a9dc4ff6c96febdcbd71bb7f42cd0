But advertising revenue for the 'duopoly' (Alphabet and Facebook) is forecast to reach $231.9bn in 2020, having topped the TV total for the first time in 2019.Alphabet's ad income is forecast to rise by 10.5% to $149.0bn worldwide, equivalent to 23 cents in every ad dollar. A full 72.4% - $107.8bn - will come from Alphabet's core Google search platform - this gives Google a 77.0% share of the global search market. YouTube is expected to earn a further $18.5bn for Alphabet in 2020, a 22.1% rise from 2019 and equivalent to 29.0% of all online video adspend worldwide.Facebook's ad revenue is projected to rise by 19.0% to $82.9bn; much of this growth is organic though the social network will benefit from the US presidential campaigns this year. Amazon's ad income is set to rise 21.4% to $17.1bn, Twitter's 9.2% to $3.3bn and Snap's 34.1% to $2.3bn. All will contribute to an overall rise of 13.2% in internet ad investment this year, to a total of $335.4bn - over half (50.9%) of the global total for the first time.James McDonald, managing editor, Warc Data, and author of the research, says: Internet ad growth has been far stronger than the state of the global economy would suggest, rising seven times faster on average since 2015. But, regulation aside, online platforms are bound by the law of large numbers, and revenue growth is easing for key players like Alphabet and Facebook."We are yet to amend our forecasts in light of the Covid-19 situation, as we would expect - if the crisis is contained - displaced spend to be reallocated later in the year. Advertising's relationship with GDP is strong, but a slowdown in economic output as a result of the virus will not necessarily translate into reduced advertising investment. If events such as the Tokyo Olympics and Uefa Euro 2020 tournament are postponed or cancelled, however, we would expect a notable impact."All product categories are expected to see growth in 2020Adspend is set to rise across all of the 19 product categories monitored by WARC. The financial services sector is expected to lead growth, with a forecast rise of 11.8% to $53.4bn in 2020. A full 53.9% of spend is directed towards online formats; banks, in particular, are looking to build brand resonance with youth demographics (increasingly via social media).At the other end of the scale, a rise of 2.6% in the retail sector is soft compared to the global rate of 7.1% but would still represent the strongest growth since 2013, lifting market value to $65bn.Consumer packaged goods (CPG) sectors such as soft drinks (+6.5% to $17.3bn) and food (+4.9% to $28.1bn) are expected to grow just behind the global rate this year, alcoholic drinks (+6.9% to $9.7bn) and automotive (6.8% to $57.2bn) are roughly par.Trends by platformAlphabet: Alphabet's advertising revenue - across Google Search, YouTube, and Google Network Members (third parties that host Google ads) - is forecast to rise 10.5% to $149.0bn this year - 22.6% of global advertising spend (up from 21.9% in 2019).
