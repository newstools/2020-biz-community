<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/539026.jpg" alt="MediaHeads 360 celebrates first year" width="500" height="187">RadioHeads was founded in 2005 and after accumulating years of experience in creating all-inclusive communications solutions, the African Media Entertainment subsidiary changed its name to MediaHeads 360 in February 2019. The name change was accompanied by a complete rebrand that more accurately reflected the company's media-centric approach and technology-based solutions.In just one year, the level one BEE media specialist entrenched itself with a number of strategic and holistic client-partner solutions; drawing on the company's history, diversity, innovation and expertise. Candy Dempers, MediaHeads 360 managing director, comments: "We have grown so much since our relaunch in 2019, but we remain ambitious and hungry to keep growing. We would never have been able to achieve this without the support of our clients and the absolute dedication of our team. The past year is a testament to the trust of our clients and our team's loyalty and commitment. Our team's diversity allows us to create solutions that speak specifically and directly to our client's audiences. We combine this with our continued exploration of current tech and global trends to create true 360° media solutions." It has been a busy year for MediaHeads 360. The company celebrated its rebrand with a bursary giveaway in February. In July, the team did their bit for our four-legged friends with a special collection and visit to Woodrock Animal Rescue on Mandela Day. And in August, the female-led organisation affirmed its dedication to education and transformation by awarding bursaries to women working in media, saying: "We firmly believe that one of the most powerful ways to uplift women is through education. Educated women teach, support and develop each other." <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/509724.jpg" alt="MediaHeads 360 - The future is female" width="120" height="120">MediaHeads 360 - The future is femaleTo mark national Women's Day, MediaHeads 360 will award five bursaries to women in the South African media space...Issued by MediaHeads 360 1 Aug 2019<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507008.jpg" alt="MediaHeads 360 activates Nelson Mandela's legacy" width="120" height="120">MediaHeads 360 activates Nelson Mandela's legacyMedia specialist agency, MediaHeads 360, will celebrate Mandela Day and Nelson Mandela's legacy by making a difference in the lives of animals cared for by the Woodrock Animal Rescue...Issued by MediaHeads 360 17 Jul 2019But it was not all play.
