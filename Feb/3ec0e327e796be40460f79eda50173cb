It allows the financial institution to connect with South Africaâ€™s up-and-coming musicians, singers and aspiring artists and houses a meeting room, coffee shop, co-working space, free Wi-Fi and two ultra-modern recording studios, the latter accessible when the aspiring musician opens an Old Mutual Money Account.
