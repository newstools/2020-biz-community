What are the obstacles and how do think it can be streamlined?It is very difficult. We need bigger budgets, but we don’t have a film culture. We need to be more responsible as filmmakers, so we cannot spend more money to make a film vs the amount of money that we can make in the box office. People don’t go to the cinema, so it’s a big problem. Standards of filmmaking can only go up if we can explore the process of film-making through the budget because budget = time.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/538675-625x439.jpg" alt="'Vergeet My Nie' director André Velts talks the universal appeal of love stories" width="625" height="439">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How much has the local industry changed since you started working in the industry?Streaming services like Netflix, Showmax and Apple TV opened some doors and closed some doors.
