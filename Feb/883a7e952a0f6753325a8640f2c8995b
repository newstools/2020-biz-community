Image via Gallo/Getty.As with most forms of discrimination, age discrimination probably doesn’t register for you unless you’ve experienced it yourself. Unfortunately, it’s an all-too-common occurrence for many, especially in the creative industries. The younger generation can’t get a job without experience, the older set with the experience are seen to be lacking the cutting-edge social and tech skills needed to flourish in business today.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/492303-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Don't forget age and experience as a diversity and inclusion factor" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Don't forget age and experience as a diversity and inclusion factorThe industry's lack of diversity and inclusion was made notably clear by last year's #TimesUp movement, largely focused on equality in race and gender. Now, with a rise of 'diversity and inclusion' focused roles popping in advertising, here's why it's important to focus on a range of ages and experience levels for true business transformation...By Leigh Andrews 15 Apr 2019 That’s why new British agency ‘Ancient & Modern’ is raising interest across the globe for it’s interesting move dubbed as “challenging the ageism in advertising head-on”.Challenging ageism in advertising, head-onFeaturing three industry heavyweights: copywriter Adrian Holmes, behavioural brand strategist Seamus O’Farrell and award-winning art director John O’Driscoll, Ancient & Modern’s homepage is reminiscent of old-school newspaper layout and speaks of the “advantages to being London’s oldest advertising agency".<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/539727.jpg" alt="Screengrab from the Ancient &amp; Modern website." width="625" height="372" rel="">Screengrab from the Ancient & Modern website.click to enlargeFittingly, phone numbers and email addresses are listed as primary forms of contact, not Skype names and social media details.Their work ranges from the laugh-out-loud funny ‘ancient’ to the quirkily clever modern, such as a short film showing the steps Unilever is taking to cut down on their own plastic waste around the world. Alan Jope, Unilever’s CEO, begins:There’s a lot of plastic pollution in the environment and the uncomfortable truth is that some of it has got our name on it, and that’s not OK.It’s an opening that just draws you in and proves this ‘old’ agency has a finger on the pulse of what’s important to today’s consumers: It also proves the point that while there’s no denying the need to keep upskilling yourself throughout your career, doing so doesn’t necessarily mean what came before is no longer valid - on the contrary.

Here's an overview...By Marie Rocher 6 Oct 2014The age of experience: Upskill yourself to become and stay relevantTackling ageism or age discrimination is really coming to the fore, as a topic that’s now being addressed at global awards shows. In fact, a few years ago, The One Club for Creativity’s CEO Kevin Swanepoel shared with our correspondent Ann Nurock:Although we are struggling with gender and diversity, I think one of the biggest things that is really affecting this industry is ageism, where you have amazing creatives and people within agencies who are being aged out as they become either too expensive or as they become too senior, because people can hire a younger team or two/three people for what it costs to hire somebody who has been there a long time.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495586-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#OneShow2019: Tackling diversity, ageism and paying for creative ideas" width="120" height="120">#OneShow2019: Tackling diversity, ageism and paying for creative ideasAnn Nurock interviews Kevin Swanepoel, CEO of The One Club at the One Show in New York to find out what the non-profit organisation has been up to over the last year...By Ann Nurock 7 May 2019He added that the most successful agencies today are those that have a workforce of blended generations that benefits from both decades of experience and what he calls the social-media savvy ‘young guns’.Ban Boomer/Snowflake talk, embrace a Perennial mentor mindsetBut don’t be tempted to fall into the ‘OK Boomer’/’Millennial snowflake’ talk either, as Nicol Myburgh, head of the HR Business Unit at CRS Technologies, says  ageism is a real problem in the South African job market. Even if a job seeker has an impressive CV and experience that stretches back many years, they might not secure the position they apply for because of their age. Similarly, referring to Millennials at the workplace as ‘snowflakes’ can also constitute harassment or ageism if the references become regular occurrences.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/538529.jpg" alt="Enough of 'OK, Boomer'" width="120" height="120">Enough of 'OK, Boomer'Ageism is a real problem in the South African job market.

This generation is energetic, switched on and most importantly, employable. Some say that they incorporate the best of the boomer traits (hardworking, value-based), and those of Millennials (curious, tech-savvy). <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/529405-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty Images." width="120" height="120">'OK Boomer' and the great generational stand-offThe generational face-off when grandpa and junior go head-to-head over which generation has it better (Mine.
