This is the question that Grid asks itself on every project, every client and every action it takes. It is the #MakeItMeanSomething company and this philosophy is what drives the agency on a daily basis to create meaningful and purposeful work. Adam Byars, joint CEO of Grid, explains: “The most successful brands, businesses and people in the world all share one common trait: What they represent means something to the communities around them.”Night of a 1000 Drawings is one of the chosen charities Grid will be sponsoring as part of its community initiative, G for Good. The event embodies the #MakeitMeanSomething philosophy that grows the arts through creativity and business. “The ideal of ‘purpose before profit’ is encapsulated in the business’s ethos: Make It Mean Something,” concludes Byars.As an agency, Grid has evolved from a specialist design agency into a through-the-line specialist brand agency and Make It Mean Something has been a driving force in its journey so far.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/538589-625x349.png" alt="The Grid sponsors Night of a 1000 Drawings as one of its G for Good collabs" width="625" height="349">About Night of a 1000 DrawingsNight of a 1000 Drawings is an art-for-charity initiative changing the lives of many across Johannesburg.
