The choice of “Paradise Road”, by South Africa’s iconic ‘80s all-female vocal group, Joy, makes the Outsurance advert even more compelling. The song and the story of the ad, which follows a young couple as they meet for the first in their youth to building a home, draw on the viewer’s own sense of beauty and nostalgia.The development of the young couple’s relationship is seen over the years and Outsurance is there with them all the way, with different products for all life stages. The brand very smartly steps away from showing a single product thereby pigeonholing itself, but shows a suite of products on offer.Agency and team creditsAd title: Come with UsCountry: South AfricaClient: OutsuranceCreative agency: OutsuranceAccount director: Carl Louw (CMO)Executive creative director: Bryn PuchertCopywriter: Bryn PuchertArt director: Nicole BinikosBusiness unit director: Leana DreyerTV production: Bryn PuchertMedia planners: Tyler Montalto, Annie BreugemProduction company: DarlingRecording studio: Stirling SoundExecutive producer: Lorraine SmitMusic and sound design: Lourens PerssonAgency producer: Fundi SheziDirector: Chloe CoetseeDirector of photography: Michael ClearyProduction art director: Lauren WilenskyEditor: Jason BassonPost-production: The LudusStills photographer: Jurie PotgieterIf you are an agency or brand with work that’s on TV, please tweet us on @OrnicoMedia and add #AfricanAdShowcase.
