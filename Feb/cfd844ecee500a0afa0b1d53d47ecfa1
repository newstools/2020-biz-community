Organisers aim to grow the number of African nationals from the nine who attended in 2019 to a lot more, in 2020 and beyond. The confirmed presence of the United Nations and the African Development Bank, in addition to confirmed attendance by delegates from as far afield as Russia, USA, Canada, Finland, UK, Portugal, India, Bulgaria, Hungary, Switzerland, etc., is indicative of the summit’s fast-growing brand awareness and interests in places beyond Africa. Africa will remain at the core of summit programme discussions, of course, while best practice examples and other destination brand management experiences will be drawn from different parts of the world, as no destination brand exists on an island of its own. While some destination reputation issues can be region-specific, in an increasingly connected world many others tend to similarly affect cities, regions, and countries across different parts of the world. These destinations can therefore learn a lot from one another’s experiences.The awardsWell-known brand reputation specialist, former PRISA President and MD of Reputation 1st Group, Tshepo Matseba, will continue to chair the summit’s Panel of Judges for the Awards. He is joined in 2020 by two new judges, Silvana Dantu, Director of African Equations, and Eric Leong Son, Director of Sustainability at Distell. Solly Moeng, Summit Convenor, serves as an honorary judge at the discretion of the panel.   Nominations for the 2020 summit awards are invited for the following award categories:1.

Being acknowledged for their work is something that recipients hold very close to their hearts,” said Tshepo Matseba, Chairman of the Summit’s Judges Panel, adding that “just like it is often said that the sweetest music to anyone’s ear is the sound of their own name,  we have seen people travel to either Cape Town or Johannesburg in 2018 and 2019 to receive their awards and to be part of the summit. In 2020, we aim to have a more colourful, African themed, Awards evening. It will be held on Thursday, June 4th in Cape Town and is billed to leave both African and global delegates asking for more,” he said.The 2020 Brand Summit Africa Award Nominations remain open until Friday, 24 May 2020.
