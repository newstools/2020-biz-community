Based on this, a campaign was designed that could deliver on multiple needs, including addressing the need for market share, building brand awareness, generating traffic to First Technology Centurion’s new website and specific landing pages, building a social media presence and, finally, generating new business leads, particularly amongst companies that would benefit from Microsoft’s CSP offerings.“Any campaign that captures leads ends up with a mix of people who are not yet ready to purchase a solution, but who want more information, as well as market-ready buyers,” says Viljoen. “We needed leads for companies we could work with regarding our specific solutions.“Choosing the right target market was key, but so was getting our messaging right. With the correct message, we could attract buyers as well as people who would eventually become buyers with the right information and assistance.”As a startup branch, a sales-ready pipeline that could be nurtured was essential as First Technology Centurion entered the market.Delivering resultsAs a value-added information technology company that supplies and implements hardware and software that are complemented by the provision of associated support services and solutions, First Technology has a very specific message, and it was important to get this right.“Working with Digital Kungfu was incredible from the people to the finished project,” says Viljoen. “The team was always available to assist and give training regarding the website,” she adds. Working with First Technology’s solutions and key messaging, Digital Kungfu’s content and production team managed the campaign end-to-end, from Google display banner campaign management to LinkedIn Lead Magnet campaign management.As a result, the First Technology Centurion campaign performed well above the initial target set. Over the period of 4 weeks, 26 performance assets were scheduled, generating 805,000 impressions in total, a huge push to drive traffic to the landing page and introduce First Technology Centurion to the market. The campaign’s target was 50 Market Qualified Leads. Instead, with focused effort and monitoring, 117 MQLs were achieved, giving First Technology Centurion the boost it needed to launch successfully into the market.
