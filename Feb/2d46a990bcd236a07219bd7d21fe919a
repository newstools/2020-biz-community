Recently-appointed Loeries COO, Suzie Bowling, says: “People don’t realise the incredible power creative minds have to impact real change that can make a real difference – and the Loeries is committed to driving the industry to use its power for positive change.“Our region – Africa and the Middle East – is ripe with opportunity for creating meaningful change. Just two examples are that only 10% of waste is recycled, and fewer than 20% of African women have access to education."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/536615.jpg" alt="Entries open for Loeries 2020 with a call for change" width="625" height="417">“We can use our creative muscle and our brand strengths to change these statistics,” Bowling adds. “It’s not just what brands say, but what they do. Consumers are savvy today. They see through cause-washing. The Loeries is calling on brands and agencies to drive change that is more than surface deep. It is not only about once-off campaigns, but change in operations, policies, culture, purpose, products, services, and the experiences we offer our customers.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/535521-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The Loeries has appointed Preetesh Sewraj as its new CEO." width="120" height="120">Preetesh Sewraj appointed new Loeries CEOThe Loeries has appointed Preetesh Sewraj as its new CEO from 1 April.
