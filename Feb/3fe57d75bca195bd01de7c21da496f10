It’s also just a nice opportunity to reward our loyal customers named Phillip de Wet.“Secondly, it’s our way of correcting some general misperceptions that may exist out there about Burger King and its bright South African future. So to clarify: We remain a profitable and growing business, with 100 new stores in the pipeline nationally, and – more importantly – we remain a responsible employer, dedicated to reducing our country’s growing unemployment rate through continued skills development and the growth of our national Burger King footprint.”So how do you redeem a voucher? Klopper says it’s as easy as going into any Burger King store nationwide and presenting your ID to prove that you are, in fact, a deserving Phillip, Philip, or Phillipa de Wet. “We’d also love to have an open and honest conversation – over a Whopper, of course – with the inspiration of our campaign, to demystify any misconceptions and hopefully grow our Phillip de Wet fanbase.”
