By providing services over the channel, organisations can expect to increase the likelihood of customer engagement and consequently loyalty due to convenience, trust and familiarity this chat app provides. As a result, they can ultimately move their business in a new direction by introducing a ‘pull strategy’ that is engaging, interactive and fun and move away from a more costly low ROI (return on investment) traditional ‘push strategy’.The customer-centric approach to communicationThe channel allows organisations to leverage rich and branded content, such as images, sound, documents and video, as well as conversations initiated by themselves or by their customers. Using WhatsApp Business API, a brand can build a rich multimedia two-way communication channel with its customers at an enterprise scale.The benefits to mid-sized to large enterprises, is that they can use WhatsApp Business API for a wide range of customer-centric communications and queries that automate processes which include applications, and registrations, status confirmations and updates, location services, transaction alerts, one-time pins, two-factor authentications (2FA’s) and payment reminders, among others.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/531765.jpg" alt="WhatsApp trends for 2020" width="120" height="120">WhatsApp trends for 2020So, you already know WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app globally, but do you know what updates are coming in 2020?..Issued by Techsys Digital 13 Dec 2019Essentially, it is the ideal communication channel for companies that have a large customer base and a large volume of business to consumer (B2C) activity, and whose call centres or offices are routinely inundated with repetitious queries. WhatsApp Business API is perfectly positioned to take over this form of communication and provide a self-service channel that is easy to use and can be automated without frustrating the customer.Increasing automation to deal with critical issuesThe benefit of introducing automation via a channel such as WhatsApp Business API into a call centre is that it frees up call centre agents to deal with more intricate and urgent queries. A recent example of this is a local bus ticketing company that handles a call volume of about 10,000 calls a week, with about 80% of the queries being about whether a bus is leaving for a specific destination on a particular day, what the price of the ticket is and what the time departure is.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/518217-120x120.jpg" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty." width="120" height="120">WhatsApp revolutionising business communicationBusinesses in Africa can't ignore WhatsApp as a potential connection point to customers to revolutionise their user experience...25 Sep 2019The company’s call centre agents had to repeatedly go through the same process, which was time-consuming, labour intensive and in some cases demoralising. Automating this communication via WhatsApp Business API, would take a massive load off the call centre and allow agents to deal with critical issues, such as attending to customers who have bought the wrong ticket, or those trying to trace a refund. These are typical issues that need human intervention, however, a team of real-time chat agents and the customer can continue to use WhatsApp to chat rather than speaking to an agent telephonically.Hence, there is no need to fear that chat apps will make humans redundant but could in fact create new positions for those who will need to become real-time chat agents, manage the system and teach the chat agents or chatbot the required language to use.Security is keyIt is also worth reiterating that WhatsApp communications are end-to-end encrypted to extremely strong standards. In fact, the chat app’s messages are more secure than many other digital channels and are just as well suited to confidential messages as SMS or email.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/518735.jpg" alt="Golden rules for WhatsApp communities" width="120" height="120">Golden rules for WhatsApp communitiesWhatsApp groups are proving increasingly more important for the dissemination of news that affects housing/street/suburb communities.
