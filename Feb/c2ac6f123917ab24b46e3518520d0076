Granted, everyone has a grandmother or aunt who so loved animals she left a sizeable portion of her estate to the local SPCA when she died – or simply took in so many strays, her home was over-run when she was alive – but by-and-large as a society two or three decades ago, we primarily viewed animals as labourers or entertainers. Today, many more of us view animals as sentient beings with emotions and feelings which not only matter but benefit us personally should we engage with them in an empathetic manner. Recent studies show that pets, most notably dogs, of people who are stressed out or anxious, synchronise the stress markers of their owners, meaning that the pet feels the same amount of stress that the owner does, at the same time. This feeling of being connected to and having his stress alleviated by his pets is true of rat dad, Felix. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/537026.png" alt="What is shaping culture? Pet parents" width="625" height="312" rel="">click to enlargeAs we have become more parental in the relationship between us and our animals, so has our level of expenditure and desire to give them treats and special treatment. BowHaus Doggy Daycare & Sleep-over Centre, based in Woodstock in Cape Town and offering a dramatically different experience to kennels of old, has seen and been a part of this change.          View this post on Instagram           Its Friday and we are going to share a little puppy love with you ... cos who doesnt need puppy love before the weekend!! A hotel, a swimming pool, post operative care, play areas with a bunch of friends curated for your enjoyment ... honestly I think that I would prefer to be a hound than a human when you get treated so well. @bowhausdoggydaycare provides all of this and more for your furry friend As Pet Parenting becomes more common, the opportunities to treat your hound, rat, bunny, cat etc grow more and more. #hyhin #petparenting #newnorms #furbaby #furbabyparentlife #furbabygram #puppylove #puppy #petsofinstagram #alternativefamily #petparent #dogs_of_instagram A post shared by  in_ (@thisisin__) on Aug 23, 2019 at 5:55am PDT At BowHaus, the dog’s personality is assessed and engaged with, to ascertain their preferred style of treatment. There is a pool, and none of the dogs are restrained in kennels but roam free to play with ‘likeminded’ friends. Also on offer is after-surgery and old-age care. Owner Claire Mariotti-Thomas rationalises the need for BowHaus: “We’ve changed the way we live. We’re moving from rural and suburban areas into urbanised zones. We don’t have our extended families around us, so animals have become part of the family and are not ‘just an outside thing’ anymore.”And part of loving someone or something is showing this love and spending money of them or it. Pet care is big business, and not necessarily affected by global fiscal fluctuations, as pet parents continue to show the love even in the hard times. From toys, snacks, psychologists and masseurs to high luxury clothing products, the list of products for sale is endless. Beer or wine for your furry friend? Yes, it’s available. Pet care books, too, contribute to the incredibly large pet care market, expected to top $269bn by 2025.And ‘Petfluencers’ like @fletcher_schnauzer and @joffypom have become powerful entities in the marketing industry, with massive followings and huge endorsement deals.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/537028.png" alt="What is shaping culture?

He didn’t grow up in an environment where dogs were just yard protectors and the word ‘pet’ was never used. But, today, his dogs are the most important people in his life. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/537030.png" alt="What is shaping culture? Pet parents" width="625" height="312" rel="">click to enlargeDog daddy, Adrian Naidoo (@VeganGymBro on Instagram) also has an incredibly close relationship with his dogs, Aries and Apollo, who ‘saved his life’. “The relationship between a pet owner and their pet completely transcends what it is. It becomes a soul-to-soul connection. I am firmly of the belief that, when you seek out a pet, you don’t choose it, the pet chooses you and comes into your life for a very specific reason. Either they need to teach you something, or you need to teach them something.”          View this post on Instagram           Adrian Naidoo is the modern ideal of a pet parent, a caring and loving guardian to his furry friends … but its not a one way street with them giving as much love and support as he does. This conversation was so incredibly enlightening for us, to see the deep clear connection and support that both Adrian, Apollo and Aries all give to each other.
