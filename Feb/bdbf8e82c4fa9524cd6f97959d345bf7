(7), Tchibo GmbH (8), Nike (9) and Decathlon Group (10).The Cotton Ranking 2020 is published by three NGOs – Pesticide Action Network (PAN) UK, Solidaridad and WWF – based on research conducted and compiled by independent consultancy Aidenvironment. Seventy-seven cotton-using companies estimated to use more than 10,000 metric tonnes of cotton annually are assessed on their public policies and commitments, how much of the cotton they use is actually from sustainable sources, and on how open they are with their supply chain traceability. Overall the Cotton Ranking 2020 reveals significant progress by big brands toward more sustainable cotton, but also that the divide is growing between companies that take their responsibilities seriously and the many laggard companies that do not.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/494037-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Adidas, Reebok and Patagonia ranked most transparent fashion brands" width="120" height="120">Adidas, Reebok and Patagonia ranked most transparent fashion brandsSportswear giants Adidas and Reebok and outdoor clothing brand Patagonia are leading the way on transparency amongst the world's 200 largest fashion brands...25 Apr 201975% of sustainable cotton sold as conventional cottonWhile 21% of global cotton production is now more sustainable, only 5% of global production is actively bought as sustainable by retailers and brands. The rest has to be sold as conventional cotton because not enough of the big brands explicitly shop for more sustainable cotton.“Shockingly, three quarters of sustainable cotton is still sold as conventional cotton. Farmer groups end up selling the majority of their more sustainable produce as conventional cotton due to lack of demand. If the failing brands took their responsibilities seriously, this wouldn’t be an issue," explains Isabelle Roger, global cotton programme manager at Solidaridad Network.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/538657.jpg" alt="Adidas and Ikea lead 2020 sustainable cotton ranking" width="600" height="390">Big brands embracing sustainable cottonProgress in sustainable cotton use has been exemplified by companies like Bestseller (Jack&Jones, Vera Moda, Only) and Decathlon, which in 2017 were ranked as ‘starting the journey’ but are now ‘leading the way’ thanks to the sharp increase in their uptake of sustainable cotton. Almost all companies who made public commitments have made substantial improvements, including well-established trailblazer IKEA, and the new front-runner Adidas. The number of companies lagging behind is largely unchanged since 2017. Around one-third of companies, including global names like Amazon, Footlocker, Giorgio Armani and Forever 21 all scored zero in the ranking, despite increasing global concerns about worsening water scarcity, pollution, land degradation, and loss of biodiversity.Alexis Morgan, WWF Global Water Stewardship Lead, says, “The ranking reveals that there is a small but growing group of frontrunners who are leading the way toward a more sustainable cotton sector, with their commitment over the last few years paying off. The report gives plenty of evidence that public commitments lead to results, however, many companies have still not taken the necessary steps. CEOs of these laggard companies must change course and make time-bound commitments to use more sustainable cotton.”  SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/510905-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Fast fashion lies: Will they really change their ways in a climate crisis?" width="120" height="120">Fast fashion lies: Will they really change their ways in a climate crisis?Recently Zara introduced a sustainability pledge.

This includes Ikea, Adidas and Marks and Spencer who are aiming to maintain their 100% sustainable sourcing track records. The report publishers encourage them all to not only meet and sustain their target over time, but also to uphold their commitment to making the global cotton sector more sustainable, and have a deeper positive impact on cotton farming communities and their environment.

Only 23 companies report on the absolute volume of more sustainable cotton they source, and most have shared this in confidence with the researchers. Only 11 companies publish how much cotton lint they source in total. Keith Tyrell, director of PAN UK adds, “Companies are not transparent enough about their supply chains and purchasing practices. We need to see more time-bound targets, higher proportions of more sustainable cotton being sourced, and transparency on where their cotton really comes from.”View the full Sustainable Cotton Ranking 2020 here.
