I am very proud of my team. It is a really great achievement for us,” said brand director of Exposure Marketing, Warren Murray.The 007-themed evening served as an opportunity to recognise and acknowledge excellence in exhibition organisation, exhibitor participation and supplier excellence. The exhibition industry arrived in full support at the Gallagher Convention Centre, dressed to kill and licensed to win in their best Bond outfits. With comedian Donavan Goliath as MC for the evening, the AAXO Roar Awards was an awesome celebration of the triumphs of the exhibition industry over the last year. MamaMagic also scooped up awards for distinctions in operations and logistics for the two Johannesburg-based expos as well as a distinction in marketing for the Cape Town expo. The MamaMagic social media campaign also received a certificate of distinction for successfully utilising social media to attract visitors to their expos. The exhibitors at the MamaMagic Baby Expo were also recognised at this ceremony with Bepanthen, Johnson & Johnson and Thule all receiving exhibitor distinctions for their stands at the various MamaMagic expos in 2019. “Each year that we win these prestigious awards, pushes us and our exhibitors to do better the next year. So, we are very excited for 2020,” says Murray. Spread the word and save the date for the 2020 MamaMagic Baby Expos.
