<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/539926.jpg" alt="Markem-Imaje and Systech International join forces" width="429" height="285">Locally represented by Pyrotec PackMark, Markem-Imaje – a global supplier of product identification and traceability solutions – has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Sys-Tech Solutions International (Systech), a leading provider of software and solutions for product traceability, regulatory compliance and brand protection. With the conclusion of the transaction, Systech will become part of Dover’s Markem-Imaje business unit and will offer brand protection, traceability and automation solutions under the Systech brand to customers worldwide. Headquartered in New Jersey, USA, Systech offers an integrated Brand Protection SuiteTM for compliance and brand protection applications, including serialisation, traceability, anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion solutions, which will help customers meet evolving product traceability regulations and growing consumer demand for product safety, security and authenticity. Systech’s proprietary and innovative e-Fingerprint® technology is a digital non-additive product authentication solution that offers superior levels of brand protection with lower complexity and cost than other analogue-based brand protection solutions. Demand for brand protection and supply chain visibility solutions is growing rapidly as issues, such as product counterfeiting and diversion, cost brand owners billions of dollars each year. Additionally, end consumers increasingly demand assurances of safety, security and authenticity from brands they trust. The acquisition of Systech will enable Markem-Imaje to cater to these market demands by enhancing Markem-Imaje’s portfolio of product identification and traceability solutions with complementary digital brand protection offerings. Systech’s and Markem-Imaje’s customers will benefit as the focused and scaled-up integrated software and service organisation will provide innovative world-class brand protection and compliance solutions to global customers while leading the digital transformation of the brand protection market. “Systech has a successful 35-year history of protecting pharmaceutical brands and products globally,” says Vincent Vanderpoel, president and CEO of Markem-Imaje. “We are excited to combine Systech’s solutions with Markem-Imaje’s products, services and global reach to become a leader in the brand protection market.” Ara Ohanian, CEO of Systech, adds: “The combination of product serialisation, traceability, digital authentication and connectivity that Systech provides is unmatched in the market. Joining Markem-Imaje will enhance R&D, innovation and global scale to better serve Systech’s and Markem-Imaje’s customers worldwide.” Terms of the transaction are not disclosed. The transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.
