This is one of them: I’ll be speaking at @designindaba later this month, on what happens to be its Silver Jubilee year. The Design Indaba stage is hallowed ground, since it’s hosted pretty much every design hero of mine. This year is no different, and I’m thrilled(/nervous) to be a small part of the extraordinary lineup. Big thanks to @ravinaidooatlarge and @tinabreidi for making this happen. And to @mbierut , who kickstarted this whole thing. S T O K E D. A post shared by  Ananya Khaitan (@ananyakhaitan) on Feb 13, 2020 at 4:40am PST Khaitan has received numerous accolades for his work.

I then go on to take a completely unprompted dig at the stupid and disastrous currency change of 2016, because why not. Spoke at @tedxnitksurathkal .
