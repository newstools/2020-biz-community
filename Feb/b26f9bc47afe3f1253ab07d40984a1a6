Image supplied.The multidisciplinary studio, set up by visionary Dutch artists Lonneke Gordijn and Ralph Nauta, is devoted to bringing humankind back to nature with technology, evoking a sense of awe and wonder in the process. Gordijn and Nauta believe that the best designer is nature itself – but their kinetic installations, created in collaboration with scientists, engineers, computer programmers, universities and research facilities, reflect the symmetry and poetry found in the natural world. The result is touchingly lyrical work that allows us to reimagine possibilities in a world of pollution and climate crisis. What it means to be alive in the 21st centuryWhether floating an enormous concrete block ten feet above spectators at The Armory’s Show’s Pier 94, or having a flock of 300 drones perform a choreographed routine above the Kennedy Space Centre to mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission launch, Drift wants us to reflect on who we are and what it means to be alive in the 21st century.

Through sensors the “ bird” notice if you are closely or not. So if the swarm loses it interest, it will fly away !

Relentlessly experimental, Drift is adamant that we need not fear technology, provided we use it to engender profoundly transformative experiences. Using data and algorithms derived from natural phenomena – like lights that mimic the flight patterns of a flock of birds – they hope to remind us of the beauty we frequently miss when gazing at our smartphones. Playing with light, movement and space, their installations provide an intimate experience of elements we frequently take for granted. Poignant portraits of a complex, unsettling, magical worldIn their Amsterdam workshop, which also functions as a test lab, Drift conceptualises artworks as diverse as The Obsidian Project (a sleek, synthetic obsidian mirror created out of recycled chemical waste), Fragile Future (a sculpture combining a metallic structure and LED lights), Meadow (a kinetic sculpture of continuously opening and closing mechanical flowers) and Shylight (a sculpture that unfolds and retreats in choreographed ‘self-defence’, much as flowers do). Meticulously designed and faultlessly executed, these projects create poignant portraits of the complex, unsettling, magical world we live in.
