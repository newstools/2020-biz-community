We have been nominated twice again this year. As the show’s executive producer, I’m proud to work with a team that uses its talents and skills to make a difference in society. We don’t do this for rewards, awards, or recognition; however, it is always encouraging when the work we do is noticed and celebrated. We are elated to once again be nominated not once but twice for this prestigious award,” says Nkepile Mabuse, Executive Producer for Checkpoint."Congratulation to all the nominees for this year's SAFTA awards; this is a humbling confirmation that e.tv is the entertainment destination of choice.
