According to the CDI, the export programme saw an average of over 50% increase in export sales (from 2016 to 2018 to European markets). The export programme focusses on the professional development of entrepreneurs, providing training and coaching to prepare them for entry into the international market. To put into practice the training, some of the businesses have participated in leading trade fairs such as Maison & Objet in Paris and Ambiente in Frankfurt. The project also provided opportunities to participate in South African trade fairs, such as 100% Design and SARCDA. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/534435-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Erica Elk, founding executive director of the Craft &amp; Design Institute" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2020: Design thinking to rise in the public sectorIn the face of increasingly tough systemic and complex challenges, there is an emerging global trend in the public sector towards using a design thinking approach to unlock new and innovative solutions...By Erica Elk 15 Jan 2020Erica Elk, executive director of the CDI, says the export development programme and the annual NEXT Trade Exhibition has been a successful platform for local small businesses to take their products and South African design to the world. “The training opportunities provided by the CDI to these South African enterprises have helped them take a significant step forward into the international marketplace, which is evident in their increase in export sales. Since the inception of NEXT two years ago, we have seen buyers visit the trade exhibition from across the world, and we fully expect that this year we will attract even more with an expanded group on our programme and the incredible new product ranges being brought into the market.”The NEXT20 Trade Exhibition has been made possible thanks to funding from the Department of Arts and Culture, with the support of the Dutch Consulate, which funded export training during the past year, and the V&A Waterfront and Workshop17, who have provided the 2020 venue.
