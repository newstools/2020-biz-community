He believes in prioritising humanity over technology and that tech should be about positive interactions, humanity, surprise and creativity. For Google’s Creative Lab, the focus is on whether the things they make are helpful and have a shot at exponential societal impact.Connecting people with technology, telling inspiring stories and sometimes inventing products people didn’t know they needed is all in a day’s work for Wong, who likes nothing more than exploring the outer limits of what design and creativity can achieve.He’s sure to hold the audience captive at Design Indaba once again, when he presents for the event’s silver jubilee edition.Follow Wong on Instagram and Twitter. Ticket sales for the Design Indaba 2020 are officially open.
