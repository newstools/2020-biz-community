Where do you live, work and play? I live in Miami and work everywhere, but mainly from our headquarters in Miami, next to the airport. I have fun at work, so I would say that I play basically everywhere. But if you are talking about personal life, I love to cook a BBQ at home; go to the park with Leo, my 4.5 years old son; and go to the movies with my wife, Annie. 2. What’s your claim to fame? I can tell the difference between an Impossible Whopper and a Classic Whopper. Just kidding… I can’t. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490356-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Stock image.

Describe your career so far. It has been a fun journey! I studied mechanical engineering in college and started to work in a Unilever factory as an intern. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1805/440869-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Fernando Machado, head of brand marketing of Burger King. © ." width="120" height="120">#OneShow2018: SA EXCLUSIVE with Burger King!In an exclusive interview, Ann Nurock talks to Fernando Machado, head of brand marketing for Burger King.

Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. Wake up. Check emails before I should. Get mildly upset with some emails. Regret checking emails. Eat something quick. Kiss my wife after she complains I am leaving without kissing her. Arrive at work (pretty fast in Miami). Meetings, meetings, meetings. Coffee. Meetings, meetings, meetings. Coffee. Emails during meetings (I shouldn’t be doing that…). Go back home. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/484207.jpg" alt="Championing local flavours in the South African market" width="120" height="120">Championing local flavours in the South African marketEzelna Jones, group marketing executive at Burger King South Africa, explains what it takes to build a global brand in our local market...Issued by Burger King 25 Feb 2019Complain to myself that I haven’t had enough time to think about things. Open the door. Say hi to my dog, who is usually sleeping. Say hi to my wife. Try to do something fun with my wife such as going to the movies, cooking together or going for a walk. No work over weekend. 7. What are the tools of your trade? These days, I use a lot of Twitter. Like, all the time. I read the news there, usually before it becomes news. I get feedback from our marketing stuff there. Sometimes ideas, too. 8. Who is getting it right in your industry? Lots of people. I love our industry. The New York Times, Nike, ABI, my competitors.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Burger King (@burgerking) on Jan 13, 2020 at 4:45pm PST Lots of people doing good work.

Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. I hate buzzwords. All of them. If something became a buzzword, it’s already too late to make any good use out of it. 12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? When I can stop and think without worrying about the meeting that will start in 10 minutes. 13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I know all the winners of advertising award shows per award, category, agency, etc. 14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? Phile! 15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Pictures of my wife and my son. Bulls#it messages from my friends on WhatsApp. Lots of emails. A fantasy football app from the Brazilian football league. 16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? Be obsessed about what you do. If you are not obsessed about our industry, go do something that you are really obsessed about.
