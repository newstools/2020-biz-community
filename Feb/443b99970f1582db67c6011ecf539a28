It's headquartered in Johannesburg and employs over 250 people. Under the consumer brand Bonsella, 2Engage subsidiary Retail Engage runs South Africa’s largest digital rewards and loyalty programme in the independent retail sector, targeting over 10 million LSM 3-7 consumers and representing some 60% of the economically active consumer base in South Africa.  With a free Bonsella loyalty card, shoppers are rewarded with instant airtime to their mobile phones for products on promotion in-store. For a fee of less than R50 per month, consumers can get a Bonsella gold card which provides a range of value-added services, including double airtime points, life cover, as well as lifestyle discounts such as discounted soccer tickets and bus tickets and vouchers for selected national retailers. The gold card also extends to access to a crisis line, health advice, clinic services, legal advice and homework help for children.According to 2Engage, the Bonsella programme has grown to 1,2 million members, growing at an average of 2,500 new members daily. It is active in 150 plus stores across South Africa, with employment opportunities offered to local communities by means of 200 in-store marketing agents who promote and sign up new members via mobile devices. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/524288-120x120.jpg?2" alt="SA's best loyalty programmes for 2019" width="120" height="120">SA's best loyalty programmes for 2019The winners of the 2019 South African Loyalty Awards were announced in Cape Town this week...1 Nov 2019Insight into the 'main market'“Low-income South Africans who live in rural provinces typically shop at nearby independent retail stores making it difficult for multinational consumer goods and services brands to target them directly. Consequently, these brands have little insight into the purchasing behaviour of consumers in the independent 'main market'," says Weinberg.Traditionally, there has been little access to shopping behaviour insights, nor the ability to individually target, communicate and reward this LSM 3-7 base, the so-called 'base of the pyramid'. Value is a huge necessity for consumers in this sector which is under acute economic pressure.“Brands have historically battled to spend marketing budget in the independent sector as it is fragmented, it is difficult to target shoppers directly and there is little reliable data on the effectiveness of marketing spend, yet with this retail sector estimated at over R100 billion turnover per annum, it constitutes a significant portion of consumer FMCG spend. Our data mining – which is POPI opt-in compliant – is proving increasingly attractive to brands,” says Weinberg.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/533348-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#BizTrends2020: Africa's double-edged consumer demand" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2020: Africa's double-edged consumer demandAfrica's consumer landscape is fragmented and polarised, characterised by the double-edged demand of a diverse base of consumers...By Ailsa Wingfield 6 Jan 20202Engage describes Bonsella as a cost-effective sales channel to this market, enabling brands to develop a targeted marketing and sales strategy. The company explains that the programme's backend technology delivers measurable sales promotions by tracing product take-up at till point (pre, during and after promotions), resulting in comprehensive basket analytics and customer purchase insight. "Not only do brands benefit from increased sales, they have access to detailed demographic consumer profiles, value reporting, as well as post-campaign research and engagement," says the company in a statement.
