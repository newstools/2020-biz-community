We called on tenor Mmusi Morekhure to come in and deliver the vocals. We reworked the lyrics in a humorous way. The lyrics say the product name "Bellissimo" and "Ottimo Cibo", which means great food.Click here to view the ad.Album recordings and final mix<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/539894-625x453.png" alt="Howard Audio blasts into 2020!" width="625" height="453">It was an absolute privilege to have the cast of Here's to You in studio as we captured their unique arrangements of more than 20 Simon & Garfunkel classic hits under the musical directorship of Wessel Odendaal and original arrangements by Bryan Schimmel, Jaco van Rensburg, Wessel Odendaal, Daniel Keith Geddes and Matthew Vlok.
