Not only are the things we use becoming more interconnected, but they are also able to access the internet, which opens up a new frontier of opportunities for digital marketers.Three ways IoT will change digital marketingWith all devices and appliances soon to be sending and receiving information over the internet, digital marketers now face a completely new set of challenges, and opportunities, to fulfil the needs of their audiences in ways never thought possible:1. End-to-end experience optimisationIn the past, marketers were only able to interact with customers throughout the promotional process. “Now,” says Schneider, “they have more opportunities to engage with customers and optimise the experience.” If we take a coffee machine as an example, digital marketers will now have the ability to send customers notifications throughout the product usage cycle, like when their beans are running low or when the machine might require maintenance.2. Enhanced search engine optimisationSearch engine optimisation (SEO) has in the past been largely concerned with optimising online content using keywords that users might type into their search bar. “However, the internet of things is changing the way people look for information online, as they move from typing queries towards issuing verbal queries (like when interacting with Google Home or Siri),” says Schneider. Digital marketers will need to focus more on optimising content for natural language processing (NLP) when performing future SEO activities.3. Accurate product usage dataWith so many household devices interconnected and communicating via the internet, the amount of usage data that digital marketers can collect will increase tenfold. In the past, marketers could only gather information such as when a device was purchased, how many of those devices were purchased and, perhaps, when they were handed in for maintenance. Now, if we take the coffee machine, as an example, marketers will be able to see data like how many cups of coffee a household consumes in a month, when the machine is turned on and off, how often the system is being rinsed, etc.The Digital School of Marketing is an online provider of accredited digital marketing education – which is accredited by the MICT Seta.
