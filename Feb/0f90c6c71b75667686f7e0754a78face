A key skill is her ability to transform data into engaging presentations that lead to evidence-based decisions and highly effective marketing plans.Coggin enjoys being able to have a positive impact on clients’ businesses through strategic marketing insights, as well as embracing the fresh challenges that market research constantly presents as a dynamic, changing discipline.“The market has changed dramatically in recent years, catalysed by the online and social media spaces,” says Coggin. “Today, marketers must put the end consumer at the heart of everything they do. On the one hand, the proliferation of media channels and increasing media consumption across multiple devices and platforms means it’s becoming harder for marketers to stand out. On the other hand, digital media – with its intuitive and enabling platforms – is enabling research marketers to reach clients and customers in a much more focused and cost-effective manner. “It is critical that marketers produce products and services that are relevant, convenient and innovative, and that researchers reflect this dynamic through agile, interactive methodologies that incorporate technical innovation and the ability to integrate multiple data streams into meaningful insights.”For more information on how BMi Research can partner you, contact Jenni at jenni@bmi.co.zabRev('brev-2684308e-b41b-48f1-949c-cf28f658ba08', '>a/\<az.oc.imb@innej>"az.oc.imb;46#&innej:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or 076 170 6989.
