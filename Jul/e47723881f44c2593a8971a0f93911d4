The latest additions to the MH team showcase our commitment to developing strategies, content and creativity with our clients in mind.”Isabelle van Niekerk joins MH as the new head of digital and development with 15 years of experience in noteworthy agencies like Base2 (ex-Wunderman), TBWA Hunt Lascaris and Joe Public United to name but a few.Danika Bester takes up the role of MH’s new head of engagement planning and social media. A fine artist turned social media and PR communicator, Danika professes to “love a digital and social media performance report a little too much”.Graham Gerber is also part of the new crew and will be responsible for the agency's multimedia design and animation output. Graham is also a highly skilled videographer, editor, bass player, bespoke leather wallet-maker and the ‘resident daredevil’ of the bunch.Last but certainly not least, Kholofelo Mamabolo and Lené van der Merwe, join the MH family as a senior digital copywriter and art director team. The #PowerPuffGirls are a dynamic duo that packs a mean punch, with one busy studying her MBA and the other lobbying for The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to run for Potus (President of the United States).Jacque Matthee, executive creative director of MH, says: “MH was quick to tap into the zeitgeist of the moment and pluck five truly amazing individuals from the creative cosmos and invite them to join our #CrazyFamily.”About Mortimer Harvey Mortimer Harvey has been building brands, solving problems and making magic happen for the past 28 years.
