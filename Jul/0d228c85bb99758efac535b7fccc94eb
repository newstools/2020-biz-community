Through this initiative, three talented students will be awarded full academic bursaries each valued at more than R255 000. The Ad Room is a platform developed by AAA School of Advertising to identify talented, passionate students that think differently. It is about giving learners an opportunity to study at a prestigious institution- AAA. The Ad Room aims to challenge grade elevens and matriculants to break through their set thinking patterns, investigate different scenarios and express their own creative or strategic ideas to reach a level of creative thinking worthy of winning a AAA bursary. Their aim is also to give the participants insight into the wider advertising industry and the career opportunities within. They are looking for 3 categories of talented youngsters:those who are visually talented and think in pictures. They probably have Art as a school subject, like to draw and would like to pursue a career in Art direction, Graphic design, Digital design etc. They will study the AAA BA in Creative Brand Communicationthose who are skilled with words, are passionate readers, love languages and are verbal thinkers.
