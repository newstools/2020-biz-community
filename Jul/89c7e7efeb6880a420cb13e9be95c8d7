TFG has been granted exclusivity to negotiate and finalise the terms and conclude the proposed transaction. "Jet is a leading Southern African retailer (by brand recognition and market share) and would provide TFG with a strategically important expansion into the value segment of the Southern African retail apparel market. The Proposed Transaction enables TFG to acquire selected parts of the Jet business, a unique opportunity which previously was not possible and is expected to give TFG significant scale at an attractive price," TFG said.The company added that the transaction construct provides it with structural risk mitigants and establishes a value retail pillar for the TFG business that would be costly and difficult to replicate organically. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/552365-120x120.jpg?2" alt="R2bn in lost sales forces Edcon to file for business rescue" width="120" height="120">R2bn in lost sales forces Edcon to file for business rescueThe Edcon group announced today that its board has passed a resolution authorising it to file for business rescue in the course of the next few days...29 Apr 2020The proposed transaction will also include the transfer of selected key executives and staff of Jet to ensure sufficient management capacity and continuity to deliver on the current turnaround plan for Jet.371 commercially-viable storesTFG’s conditional offer includes:• The acquisition of the Jet brand;• The assumption of a minimum of 371 commercially viable Jet stores.
