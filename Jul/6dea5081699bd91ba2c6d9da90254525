The term was first coined in 2003 as a reference for the Sars epidemic, the OED reminds us.Did you know that ‘self-isolation’ was first used in 1834? ‘Shelter-in-place’ was a 1976 public instruction in the event of a nuclear or terrorist attack. ‘Social distancing’ was first used in 1957, but then referred to “an aloofness or deliberate attempt to distance oneself from others socially.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/b/1803/6648.jpg?3" alt="Marie Yossava" width="120" height="120">Crisis Management - how to turn it to your advantageRead any tender or brief document and, undoubtedly, the question of crisis management tops the list of corporate communications criteria.

While the abbreviation ‘PPE’ dates from 1977, the full phrase ‘personal protective equipment’ goes all the way back to 1934.

Below is a choice selection:Covidiot: A person who ignores public health adviceCovideo party: Online parties via Zoom or SkypeCovexit: The strategy for exiting lockdownRona and Miley Cyrus: Words for the coronavirus itself, with the latter being Cockney rhyming slang apparentlyBlursday: Lockdown’s disorientating effect on one’s sense of timeZoombombing: Hijacking a Zoom video callQuaranteams: Online teams created during lockdownWhile a lot of these are fun words that highlight the adaptability of the English language in this crazy time, they are also a means of coping with the ‘new normal’ and describing how we all live and work in the shadow of a global pandemic.As an industrial marketing agency working in diverse sectors, we also have to be aware of these changes, and how the ‘new normal’ has impacted on our clients’ businesses.

Be careful. Be afraid...By Chris Moerdyk, Issued by Chris Moerdyk 17 Jun 2020While ‘talking the talk’ is an important part of PR in that it demonstrates we know what is going on, the danger of any kind of jargon is that it can become a lazy shorthand, and therefore ultimately meaningless. Any marketing collateral or communication must still be informative, credible and easy to understand. Those fundamentals will never change.
