In 2019, a second roadside digital was built on the M5 Highway in Cape Town which cemented the partnership,” says Harris.This merger has been in the making for some time and the Covid-19 pandemic brought about the urgency to conclude the partnership to ensure the best possible outcome of the outdoor advertising market. Both partners are Cape Town based and the merger further strengthens their position in the Cape Town market. The combination of UrbanSigns portfolio and Tractor’s knowledge and resources will provide our clients with added value and far better access to the market. The partnership and pooling of resources is expected to result in higher efficiencies. "It is my pleasure to announce that UrbanSigns and Tractor are now a fully formed partnership.
