Watch White Square 2020 Award Ceremony here.Alena Ustinovich, chairman of Board of Association of Communication and Marketing Agencies of Belarus, producer of White Square festival, noted: For the communications industry, this year has been a real challenge in every country around the world, a challenge for each of us and for our teams. Today, as never before, our industry needs a fresh breath, a portion of inspiration and a bit of creative adventurism, which we ourselves usually carry to all spheres of the economy, culture and society as a whole, thanks to Advertising Festivals in general and White Square in particular. I am glad that almost one thousand entries that took part in the festival reflected strong nature of our industry, which is committed and able to win.The winners of White Square 2020:Creative agency of the festival, which received the biggest number of awards – BBDO Moscow, RussiaBelarusian agency of the festival – TDI Group BelarusGrand PrixKak tebe takoe, Elon Musk?, Ruport, RussiaRussian Yoga School, Zebra Hero, RussiaChange for GoodChange for Good / FilmGoldThe Choice, Marvelous LLC, RussiaRussian Yoga School, Zebra Hero, RussiaSilverThe safest place, Artem Nugmanov/Self employed, RussiaBronzeCloser to moms, Salmon Graphics, BelarusShortlistNow You Understand, Not Perfect Riga, LatviaStay at Home, Not Perfect Riga, LatviaFast internet for meaningful use, Not Perfect Riga, LatviaMy Lockdown, Mr. Da Vinci, BrazilChange for Good / PrintGoldSpecial Edition, Y agency, UkraineSilverFor More Life, Kraken, GeorgiaArt of Quarantine, Looma, UkraineEqual Colors, White Rabbit Budapest, HungaryRead vs. Covid, SEED a creative agency, KazakhstanBronzeDon't play hide-and-seek with life, Kollegi, RussiaOff Road, in house, Mood, PeruMask the tunnels, Havas Creative Group Ukraine, UkraineShort-listBurger King Belgium - Stay Home, Buzzman, FranceThe Physical Violence Virus Cell, Cheil Centrade, RomaniaHair Dryer, Salsa, PeruAnother seas, entries Another seas: The Sea of Tranquility, Another seas: Acidalian Sea, Ruport, RussiaChange for Good / RadioSilverSea of ideas, Leo Burnett Ukraine, UkraineChange for Good / CampaignGoldWe Are Siberia, TUTKOVBUDKOV, russiaA Team of One, Loong, ChinaSilverFont of Kindness, SMETANA, RussiaThe sound of Indifference, watergunz, GeorgiaOur Sea, Possible Moscow x Suprematika, RussiaBirds Records, BBDO Moscow, RussiaN23, Action, RussiaOnline-game about living by touch, Cause marketing agency RedMe (belongs to the group of companies RCG), RussiaBronzeA Humane Ending, Nord DDB Riga, LatviaBee in touch, Starcom, Leo Burnett Moscow, RussiaSurvivors, BBDO Moscow, RussiaMy Name Is Enough, Doping Creative Agency, ArmeniaFreedom is near, Movie, Russia (moved from S1 Change for Good / Film)Shortlist#BoobCulture - Breast Cancer Awareness campaign, Nord DDB Riga, LatviaUnsilent bouquet, GForce/Grey, Kazakhstan#safeisthenewsexy, Magic Camp (Yandex.Taxi), RussiaWheelchange Tours, FCB Lisbon, PortugalSpecial prize for great impactFont of Kindness, SMETANA, RussiaSpecial prize for product designWheelchange Tours, FCB Lisbon, PortugalChange for Good / InteractiveGoldTerms Against Bullying, White Rabbit Budapest, HungarySilverOnline-game about living by touch, Cause marketing agency RedMe (belongs to the group of companies RCG), RussiaLessons Of Auschwitz: Volumetric VR Illustration Tribute By School Students, RT, Russia (moved from S1 Change for Good / Film)BronzeFlyHome, TUTKOVBUDKOV, RussiaTrip In The Dark , Voskhod, Russia (moved from S4 Change for Good / Campaign)Shortlist#TakeMEMEhome, BBDO Moscow, RussiaDigitalWebsitesBronzeTrip In The Dark, Voskhod, RussiaShortlistBBDO Daily, Proximity Russia, RussiaInteractive projectsBronze "Look at the World like a Child", Humanz, RussiaDyatlov Group's Journal: The Last Page, Ruptly, GermanyShortlistOnline-game about living by touch, Cause marketing agency RedMe (belongs to the group of companies RCG), RussiaOnline video and Viral filmGoldAd that you can feel by skin, Proximity Russia, RussiaSilverRussian Yoga School, Zebra Hero, RussiaBronzeLast rave, Zebra Hero, RussiaShortlistVOKA SMARTFAKE, TDI GROUP, BelarusBirds Records, BBDO Moscow, RussiaPre-rollsBronzeAd that you can feel by skin, Proximity Russia, RussiaDigital CampaignGoldBirds Records, BBDO Moscow, RussiaSilverThe Greatest Reads, Contrapunto, RussiaBronze AI Versus, Voskhod, RussiaViral campaignGoldRussian Yoga School, Zebra Hero, RussiaBronzeTrivial Pursuit Hotel, Media Agency - OMD Media Direction; Communication Agency - Leo Burnett Moscow, RussiaShortlistVOKA SMARTFAKE, TDI GROUP, BelarusSocial and Influencer CampaignGoldRussian Yoga School, Zebra Hero, RussiaBronze#TakeMEMEhome, BBDO Moscow, RussiaShortlistTera Botin, Leavingstone, GeorgiaNative AdvertisingSilverPerfect Search, BBDO Moscow, Russia (moved from D4 Pre-rolls)BronzeAd Blindness?
