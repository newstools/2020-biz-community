Nestlé South Africa has since confirmed the announcement."The Nestlé Chocolate Log has been a loved brand for over 50 years and we thank our loyal consumers for their support over these years," the food and beverage giant said."We equally understand that its discontinuation may somehow disappoint some of our loyal consumers. Excitedly though, we are bringing a variety of delicious chocolates in the coming months and we urge our consumers to be on the lookout!“As Nestlé, our purpose is to delight our consumers through tastier and healthier products.  We know that one of the main drivers of the chocolate category is innovation and that consumers love new products.  Taking this into consideration, we do discontinue certain products and introduce new ones to the market," Nestlé added.Many South Africans aren't taking the news too well:Nooo.
