But I reckon the shareholders of Crossfit can very clearly count the cost of their CEO’s tweets regarding #blacklivesmatter - they lost a major sponsor and over 1000 gyms disassociating themselves from the chain. Or the public relations nightmare for Dischem who are counting the costs of a price-gouging suit; and litigation with landlords over rent disputes during lockdown. At play at the moment is the fallout for Facebook of major advertisers pulling their spend. Those businesses most likely had an army of accountants on call; legions of lawyers on hand, and by my reading no one counselling them on their biggest vulnerability - what their customers are thinking and feeling. Or put another way; “What the mood is out there?”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/549394-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Jo Szczepanska on ." width="120" height="120">Back to basics: brand-safe communication strategies for Covid-19 and beyond'The plethora of fake news sites, and a wealth of disinformation that is almost as virulent as the disease gripping the globe, highlights the necessity for brands now to rethink their message - and the platforms they share it on.'...By Gayle Edmunds 15 Apr 2020How would PR have helped?How would PR have helped? Well for one, we would have known immediately how any of their actions would be received - badly. We have a good understanding of how things will resonate - we’re outward-facing, dealing with your public and their proxies daily. Secondly, we should not and don't blindly push the internal company line, or ideas or practices without questioning them. We know what will fly and what will not from years of experience dealing with the most hard-nosed of consumers - journalists; and now through social media, dealing with your consumers directly. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/557943-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Photo by Andrea Piacquadio from ." width="120" height="120">Pursuing purpose: The key to building resilient brandsThe way to a consumer's heart in our world today is through the creation of a purpose-driven brand identity...By Anele Nzimande and Thabiso Bhengu 28 May 2020Thirdly, we’re acutely sensitive to, and understand the risks posed by a crisis, and that the best response is to avoid one at all costs; as the cost can be your reputation. Your business is built on its reputationAnd loss of reputation is a compounding issue. When Dischem ran into another Covid-19 issue earlier this month, this time with its staff, for charging them for Covid testing, the media referenced their two earlier Covid problems - price gouging and rent disputes. So anyone coming to this story for the first time suddenly has a broader context that doesn't look good.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/556483-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Photo by Infralist on ." width="120" height="120">A moment of reckoning for businessAs the Covid-19 pandemic disrupts lives and damages economies, society is looking to big business for leadership and solutions.

Reputations are built over time, one day at a time; but lost overnight. And then they need to be rebuilt again, one day at a time, but this time from ground zero. I fail to understand why a business will risk that. This is life unfiltered. Justice is swift. So take some good advice and ensure public relations is in your inner counsel.
