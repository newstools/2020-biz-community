Projections show the video game market in South Africa growing from R3.5bn ($192bn)  in 2018 to R5.44bn in 2023. According to a report by PWC, “smartphone-driven social and casual gaming growth is not coming at the expense of profits from traditional gaming hardware.” Add in the recent introduction of 5G to both mobile and fixed wireless, the southern hemisphere nation is staged for big gaming market growth. 365 Digital, an independent multi-channel media company, provides innovative advertising opportunities and marketplaces of premium ad inventory to brands and end-to-end publisher monetisation and technology solutions. By partnering with Anzu, the company will give advertisers the ability to programmatically serve immersive ads seamlessly into the gameplay at scale, thereby creating new opportunities to connect brands to coveted gamer audiences without disrupting the gaming experience. Anzu, the world leader in programmatic in-game advertising, allows ads to be served in IAB- recognised formats. In partnership with cybersecurity firm Cheq, they recently announced the results of a pilot campaign showing 23% higher ad viewability compared to traditional digital advertising. Anzu is the only in-game advertising solution to offer a full suite of trusted adtech integrations including Forensiq, which detects and tracks fraud in real-time, and Nielsen Connectivity, a brand-lift solution that measures key metrics such as brand desire, brand recall and brand memorability. These solutions, many of which are commonplace in the greater world of digital advertising, give brands more confidence than ever before to spend in-game. As part of the collaboration, Anzu will open up their exclusive gaming inventory across PC, mobile and console to 365 Digital’s new and existing customers, empowering them to leverage in-game as another advertising touchpoint. “The ability to target audiences and measure data and viewability in real-time across consoles and platforms is something we are particularly excited about,” says Jethro Fitz-Patrick, publisher services manager at 365 Digital, “We’re very quickly moving towards a standard where 100% viewability is expected and becomes the norm. It’s great to work with Anzu and be a part of this fundamental transition.”Julian Jordaan, commercial director of 365 Digital, comments: “Anzu is a game-changer for advertisers. The Anzu team and their products have been making waves in the global markets and we’re thrilled to partner with them to do the same in South Africa.
