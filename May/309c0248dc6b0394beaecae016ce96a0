Marketing during times of crisis, helps brands re-evaluate how they can service their customers as well as find innovative ways to keep their doors open.This is the time for brands to stand out, to make themselves more memorable and build loyalty through small, human-centric engagements. How you interact with your customers now, will set the tone of your relationship with them for years to come.The research speaks for itself and has consistently revealed that brands that maintain marketing efforts during times of crisis actually grow their sales and market share. On the flip side, cutting spend has a lasting, and negative impact on brands, who find themselves losing market share, even once the crisis has passed and things go back to normal.Brands should think in the long-termDuring challenging times many brands reduce their brand-building efforts and instead, channel efforts towards driving short-term sales.

The bottom line is that now is not the time to do nothing, or to panic, or wait around nervously to see what your competitors are up to. Marketing in the time of Covid-19, or during any crisis for that matter, calls for brands to assess how they can service their customers as well as keep their businesses afloat.As Seth Godin once said, We’ve greatly exaggerated the risk of sinking, without celebrating the value of swimming.
