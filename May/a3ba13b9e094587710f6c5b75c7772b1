Drama: The Stop Line of Love” was recognized with the top creative honour, New York Festivals Best of Show Award for their campaign for highlighting jms’ wide selection of items through a series of 10-second dramas. The episodes, modelled after a favourite Japanese daytime soap opera, ends with a punchline engaging viewers and building brand perception while emphasising the broadness of the product line. “10 Sec. Drama: The Stop Line of Love” also was recognised with a Grand Award and a Gold Tower.HakuhodoYusuke Kanda, creative director, Hakuhodo said: “First of all, we feel a lot of respect and appreciation to all the juries and festival members to carry out the award at this difficult time. We are so honoured to be able to receive such an honourable award. The most difficult point was, how to connect the product with the feelings of viewers within such a limited time (10 seconds). Our solution was to include products that exist “Real” in our daily life, with the world of Drama “Fiction”, by exquisite balance to create comfortable views and binge-watch through a film-like structure. The key was to turn the most boring part of an advertisement, product cut, into the most fun and enjoyable part to create binge watch. And this was achieved by returning to the origin of what an advertisement should be. To be able to achieve, this historically international and honourable award gives us a lot of courage and we feel so much appreciation that cannot be expressed by words. Thank you.”  Innovative creative workThe executive jury awarded the following agencies for their innovative creative work with the 2020 New York Festivals Grand Award:Activation & Engagement: BBDO Atlanta – “Stop Traffick” Street GraceAvant-Garde/Innovative: Forsman & Bodenfors – “The E.V.A.
