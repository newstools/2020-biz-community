Yet these businesses also need to take into account the inevitable reputational damage and backlash that the media industry will trigger (as non-law-abiding businesses have already found in Europe under GDPR). The great news is that businesses now have an opportunity to leverage advances in technology (and specifically, secure and compliant data sharing platforms) to pursue new and highly beneficial partnership marketing opportunities in the South African market. Notably, partnership marketing can deliver the same scale and cost-benefit without alienating customers or incurring significant fines. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/529172-120x120.jpg?2" alt="281 billion and counting: Email is here to stay and it's a good thing" width="120" height="120">281 billion and counting: Email is here to stay and it's a good thingTwo-hundred-and-eighty-one-billion. That's a lot of emails being sent every day by some 4 billion email users around the world. And while many of us feel like we're on the receiving end of about 1 million a day, at least, email isn't going anywhere. Particularly not for marketers and advertisers...By Jason Liebenberg 28 Nov 2019Gathering data, at scaleWhile businesses are well aware that there is almost limitless consumer data sitting with retailers, telecoms providers, financial services providers, etc, the challenge has been finding ways to securely, legally, and affordably share this data. Moreover, many customers are eager to receive messages from service providers via approved communications channels. Under existing partnership marketing models, many businesses already act like publishers (in some respects) by using platforms to communicate curated marketing messages from selected partners. However, these models have historically been limited in scale and reach because they require the legal (and secure) sharing of consumer data between businesses (and most businesses do not have the consent from their customers to share their personal information with other businesses to make this scalable and simple).  Until now, that is.  By harnessing new, secure data sharing technology, businesses can explore the growth opportunities in each other’s databases without ever actually sharing sensitive personal information about their customers at all. Moreover, businesses can leverage shared insights to automatically target relevant audiences in their marketing partner’s CRM solution. This will arguably create new value for many businesses and allow them to capitalise on their data assets – while also benefiting consumers with curated and personalised communications.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/533748.jpg" alt="#BizTrends2020: Data becomes ever more precious in 2020 and beyond" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2020: Data becomes ever more precious in 2020 and beyondGlobal lawmakers' growing concern with privacy is forcing marketers to rely more heavily on their first-party data. For the foreseeable future, CMOs will need to turn their minds to how they can use this data to create content that answers consumers' needs and captures their minds and loyalty.By Ansa Leighton 15 Jan 2020Privacy-by-DesignWhile the concept of partnership marketing is not new, what is certainly new is the ability to keep your customers’ private data from ever needing to be shared in the process - and thus enable new partnerships to be formed very quickly and to scale up at speed. In the technology sphere, we call this ‘privacy-by-design’, which means that sophisticated data sharing solutions have been built from the ground up with privacy (and security) being a central function. Naturally, this means that businesses can harness secure data sharing technology to eliminate PoPIA compliance risks when pursuing growth opportunities. For savvy marketers, this can be nothing short of revolutionary, as secure data sharing technology opens up myriad opportunities. In essence, partnership marketing can now be evaluated and executed significantly faster to match the scale and exceed the accuracy and insights that have been available through direct marketing to date.  If businesses were wondering who – or what – was going to fill the impending void that will be left by non-compliant direct marketing practices, they now have their answer. The first movers will be richly rewarded.
