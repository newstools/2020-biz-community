The 2020 edition of the talent search asks creatives to respond sensitively to a seating solution in the time of physical distancing. The Covid-19 pandemic has left much of the world with no choice but to maintain self-isolation – a momentous shift that will undoubtedly leave its mark on society. Once global lockdowns have lifted, it is likely that a level of physical distancing will remain, even if temporarily.According to Nando's, this impacts on how restaurants will cater to customers in terms of spatial design, layout and furniture. Every Nando's Casa currently has a waiting bench for take-away patrons to sit on while their orders are fulfilled. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/555598.jpg" alt="The Hlabisa Bench by Houtlander in collaboration with Mash.T Design, with a backrest handwoven by the master weavers of Hlabisa in rural KwaZulu-Natal." width="600" height="472">The Hlabisa Bench by Houtlander in collaboration with Mash.T Design, with a backrest handwoven by the master weavers of Hlabisa in rural KwaZulu-Natal.Nando’s is asking the question: “Could a bench adapt its current form to allow for social distancing?” The 2020 talent search is calling on aspiring furniture designers to imagine the future by designing a show-stopping bench that is true to the times.Prospective entrants should consider how this bench could be easily adapted once the pandemic subsides and we can safely sit together once again.
