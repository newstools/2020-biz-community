Sales service delivery may change and evolve and acknowledging and celebrating the commitment of media professionals will be a necessary morale boost.It is currently anticipated that the voting process, which was scheduled to start in June, will now kick-off mid-November and close on 15 December 2020. While the organisers acknowledge the uncertainty brought about by the Covid-19 crisis, they believe it’s important to keep the industry informed about plans for this prestigious event and will continue monitoring the situation. Further information regarding the awards criteria will be provided over the coming months.
