With my team, we built an amazing culture that led to years of great work. I remain proud of the role we played, after selling to FCB, in transforming it into an integrated agency. However, when my five-year management commitment ended, I decided to shift my focus towards my family and some adventurous travelling. So, we took our three kids out of school and travelled around the world for six months.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1703/385395-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Team Hellocomputer on the Bookmarks 2017 stage." width="120" height="120">#Bookmarks2017: Digital download with...

Naturally, this conversation came up amongst us. We briefly placed the scenario on a pedestal extolling how wonderful it would have been locking down in some majestic tropical paradise. However, the reality of being far from loved ones during an unprecedented crisis swiftly dawned upon us. Not to mention the implications of a year's worth of planning going out the window!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the timing of this coinciding with the launch of Fierce.Everyone has a war story and Fierce is no different. Fortunately, the model is designed to be both highly efficient (no permanent production resource) and operate remotely so it will weather the storm..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How has Fierce responded to the lockdown and global crisis?We’ve redesigned the new business strategy and shifted focus away from the USA. Plans to establish relationships at key industry events such as SXSW (Austin, USA), Creative Week (New York, USA), Festival of Creativity (Cannes, France), etc. have been kiboshed for 2020, and developing ad network partnerships appears improbable as they are understandably focused on retaining revenue within their networks..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the impact of this on the business and industry.The global slowdown will bring severe pressures on businesses and the marketing industry especially. Budget cuts, looming retrenchments, depressed consumer demand and an increasingly complex industry will make marketers’ lives increasingly difficult. Businesses will expedite their digital transformation in both their workflow processes and their marketing. Correspondingly we’re anticipating an uptick in the adoption of marketing data analytics to track returns and limit wastage. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1406/204072-120x120.jpg" alt="[IMCC] Creativity through hacking" width="120" height="120">[IMCC] Creativity through hackingDavid Moffatt, Managing Director of Hellocomputer, believes that creativity and emotional advertising are keys to integrated marketing, and 'hacking' is one of the doors to creativity.By Sindy Peters 12 Jun 2014.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the gap in the market you identified and how your business seeks to solve this problem.South Africa possesses outstanding creative and technical expertise that easily competes with the best in the world. But at a fraction of the cost. Fierce is a trustworthy and experienced conduit through which international agencies and clients can do business with this talent.Equally relevant is the fact that complexity of the martech landscape demands deep expertise in certain disciplines. These are best served by companies or individuals with a laser focus on a specific skill set. Fierce assists brands, clients and agencies to unlock solutions on a project basis. Permanently hiring capabilities for these passing requirements doesn’t make financial sense for agencies or clients that have in-housed their marketing.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/556929.jpg" alt="#StartupStory: Being distinct in advertising now demands being not just brave, but fierce" width="625" height="417">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did you come up with the name?I’m a musician and can’t help but make up band names. So, consider it a South African electro-indie rock band that has global ambition. But if you’re looking for an adman response, I’d say something like being distinct in advertising now demands being not just brave, but fierce!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What barriers have you had to overcome to get to the launch phase?The main challenge is to create awareness and build credibility in foreign markets, and perhaps to ingrain the behaviour change to outsource to South Africa..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Given the global crisis, what has changed in terms of your next steps/vision for the company?The vision remains firm, which is to build an offshore network of talent to service international agencies and marketers. I'm conscious of Fierce’s determination being misconstrued as an under-appreciation for the severity of the situation we all find ourselves in so we are cautiously testing demand. However, trading and contributing to stimulating the South African economy is essential. So we have to push on. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is your view on the future of work? Data-led creativity that is digital-first, contextual and personally relevant. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any trends in this space that you’re particularly excited about? The martech gold-rush is fascinating. I’m excited by the potential of data to provide one view of the customer experience and actionable insights to continually improve the return on marketing investment. This is a key strategic area for fierce.Creativity remains the most transformative power on the planet. Humans are fundamentally creative. Yes, all of us! And I believe that South Africa should aspire to be the most creative country in the world. That will lead to immense progress on many fronts, and I hope that Fierce plays a small part in that.For more info, visit www.fierce.global.
