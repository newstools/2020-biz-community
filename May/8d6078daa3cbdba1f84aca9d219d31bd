Casale and Crayola systematically created crayon colours that step down from light to deep shades across rose, almond and golden undertones, resulting in a global shade palette that reflects the full spectrum of human complexions."Growing up, I remember mixing the pink and dark brown crayons to try and make my shade, so I was thrilled when Crayola asked for my help to create the Colors of the World crayons," commented Casale. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/557652.jpg" alt="Crayola's new pack of crayons reflects multicultural skin tones" width="600" height="508">The crayon packs feature side panels that serve as colour references and each crayon is wrapped in a gradient skin tone label with the colour name in English, Spanish and French, and purposefully has a realistic colour name – such as Light Golden, Deep Almond and Medium Deep Rose – all to help kids easily find the shade they identify as their own."With the world growing more diverse than ever before, Crayola hopes our new Colors of the World crayons will increase representation and foster a greater sense of belonging and acceptance," says Crayola CEO Rich Wuerthele. "We want the new Colors of the World crayons to advance inclusion within creativity and impact how kids express themselves."Crayola Colors of the World crayons will be available in the United States, exclusively at Walmart.
