It gives recognition to the creators and producers, and also to the clients who make it happen. It inspires them to continue their excellence. And it inspires others to reach higher and work harder because every great idea needs great execution to even be considered. Each year the very best work is recorded and the new standard is set. And the world's creative energy continues to find new solutions and create new experiences and touch new audiences. In our world, there is no status quo.The ADC 99th Annual Awards, the world’s longest continually-running show celebrating excellence in craft and innovation in all forms of design and advertising, is part of The One Club for Creativity, the world’s leading nonprofit organization supporting and celebrating the global creative community.
