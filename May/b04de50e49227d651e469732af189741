As people continue to adapt to their new way of life, including the new limits and boundaries imposed upon them, they are looking to brands to see where they either do, or don’t, fit into this new form of existence. The danger for many organisations is that, as the lockdown lengthens, consumers’ connection with their old faithful and trusted go-to brands will begin to wane, so now is not the time for brands to shy away – it is time for brands to be bold.
