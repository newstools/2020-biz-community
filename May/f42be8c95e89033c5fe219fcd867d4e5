In phase two, grade nine’s will be offered advice. This is often the point at which learners seek direction on what to study and which career path to follow. Wits will provide printed material for learners following the live sessions, which will be taking place from Wednesday, 6 May from 3pm to 4pm for a period of three weeks.  Parents and learners will be given an opportunity to engage with the facilitator after the live-streamed presentation. Learners are encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity during the Q&A session, which is designed to ensure that they are well equipped and guided in their decision-making.
