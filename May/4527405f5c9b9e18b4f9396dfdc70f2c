Agencies and national trade bodies need to work together as never before to maintain market access for our services, support employment for our people, and create tangible value for our clients. We will be taking the broadest possible definition of the 'European market', including opportunities in Eastern Europe, Turkey and the continued close engagement with the UK, irrespective of the final terms of Britain's formal departure from the EU. Dominic Grainger, previous president of the EACA, says: “It has been an honour and a pleasure to work with such a strong, diverse team of communications leaders from across Europe over the last four years. The impact of the pandemic over the last few months has shown some of the value that communications agencies with their clients and media partners can bring to their communities and I am sure that Paul, Tamara and the team can build on this to ensure EACA plays an even more valuable role in the future.”  Says Tamara Daltroff, EACA director-general: “I could not be more delighted that Paul accepted to take on the presidency role. In this difficult period, Paul is the perfect senior agency leader to guide EACA and the industry with his experience and knowledge. The agency world has been through fundamental changes over the last decade and continues to evolve in these very dynamic times. On behalf of all EACA members, I also want to thank Dominic for his leadership and outstanding involvement during his tenure. He has played a key role for EACA over the last four years.” “It is with great pleasure to take on my new responsibilities as president of the EACA and to continue the great work done by Dominic. Although we are in extremely challenging times, I am confident that with the support and strength of the committee we will be able to achieve many things,” states Paul O’Donnell. O’Donnell has been with Ogilvy for over 30 years. He has worked in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, running geographic operations and working with major international and local clients. In May 2014, O’Donnell was appointed chief executive of Ogilvy EMEA. He is a member of the agency’s international executive management group and an executive partner of the Ogilvy Group Worldwide. In addition to representing European agencies to the EU Institutions in Brussels, EACA runs the Effie Awards Europe to reward the most effective campaigns in Europe; and the IMC European Awards to recognise the best brand activation efforts in the region. In the last few years, EACA has also created Inspire! by eaca, a hub for education and training opportunities in the commercial communications industry. Its aim is to raise industry standards by providing innovative and customised training solutions to students and young professionals.
