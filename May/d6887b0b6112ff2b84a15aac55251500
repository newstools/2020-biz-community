The printing and insertion of promotional retail inserts into newspapers as well as the printing of magazines and other essential printed material began on 4 May 2020. “We are extremely pleased to report that we will be re-opening the Caxton commercial printers, and that advertisers will now be able to place insert orders through Spark Media,” says Gill Randall, CEO of Spark Media. “It is a small step to getting the economy back on track, and giving South Africans credible, hyper-local news. Besides the print factories, publishing divisions are resuming operations and aim to gradually return to full capacity as soon as possible.It is with great joy to announce that most of our local newspapers, with added inserts will once again be delivered as soon as next week.” Managing Director of Caxton Local Newspapers, Jaco Koekemoer adds: “To ensure that everyone remains safe and healthy, we have been and will be following an extremely rigid and strict hygiene regime that still includes distancing, the wearing of protective gear and as per government regulations, we’ll be operating with just a third of our staff for now.”Randall concludes: “Caxton would like to thank our advertisers and media owner partners for all the support thus far. We encourage our clients to communicate with their respective Spark Media or Caxton/CTP sales representative and advise of any requirements.”The Spark Media rate card can be viewed at http://sparkmedia.co.za/Spark MediaEstablished in 2015, Spark Media, a division of CTP Ltd, are experts in retail and location-based marketing solutions.
