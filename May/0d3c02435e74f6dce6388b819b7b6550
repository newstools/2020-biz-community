We’re proud that we got to work with the University of Kent, as it is one of the UK’s forward-thinking academic institutions. This is an indication that we’re heading in the right direction with our digital and mobile app community offering.”University communities are highly communicative and interactive, so it makes sense, given our track record of helping traditional media organisations establish digital communities, to prioritise this sector - Publisher’s Toolbox product director John MilesSimone Davis, interim director of marketing at University of Kent, says: “We’re delighted that our collaboration with Publisher’s Toolbox has given us an exciting way to engage with applicants, showcase our academic excellence and welcome future students to our University community.”About Publisher’s ToolboxPublisher’s Toolbox is a proudly South African digital product and platform provider with a 10-year digital transformation track record within the media, brand, education and sports industries.
