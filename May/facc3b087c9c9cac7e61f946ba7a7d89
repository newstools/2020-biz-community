Judges will consider the change achieved through design transformation, such as growth for the business, and impact on customers, staff or suppliers.The Next categories award emerging creatives, designers, directors and illustrators to recognise the next generation of creative talent. The platform seeks to recognise their work and showcase their ideas to creative influencers, mentors and agencies. All 233 shortlisted pieces are showcased on the D&AD website.Following the first D&AD Shortlist announcement last week, today’s announcement only includes a further 11 out of the total 34 categories. Further, shortlists will be unveiled once the judging for each category closes, with subsequent category announcements scheduled for 4 June and 2 September. Pencil winners will be announced on 9, 16 June and 8 September. A full list of dates can be found below. While hosting a 2020 ceremony is not possible due to coronavirus, D&AD will be announcing this year’s Pencil winners via their website and in a social campaign designed by Studio Dumbar. Tim Linsday, D&AD Chairman, commented: Though we are only in stage two of the judging process for this year’s D&AD Awards, it is clear that the quality of work in 2020 is already at an outstanding level. It is important to celebrate and inspire creative excellence throughout the most trying of times, and today's announcement of work across a diverse series of categories embodies this spirit. We are excited to announce subsequent shortlists across the next few weeks and continue recognising the most innovative minds across the global creative community.D&AD this year continues to platform the most exceptional work from the past 12 months, following the same rigorous judging process that holds creativity to the highest standards. Famously tough to win, there are no quotas for D&AD Awards, meaning that the number of awarded entries fluctuates each year. In some years, no Black Pencils - the highest creative accolade - are awarded. The highest ever awarded in one year currently stands at seven. Winning work will not only receive an esteemed D&AD Pencil, but it will also be featured in the D&AD Annual and online archive – the definitive guide for creatives all around the world.
