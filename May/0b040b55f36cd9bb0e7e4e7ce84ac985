MojoReporter eliminates the need for these multiple file transfer mechanisms by allowing teams of content creators to submit digital content from their Android devices or iPhones via the app, directly to a private team dashboard. What could be easier? Digital multimedia packages of photos, videos, audio files and GPS locations can be uploaded quickly and securely by anyone who is part of your media gathering ecosystem, whether they’re journalists out in the field, brand ambassadors as part of an influencer network, content freelancers and more.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/555823.png" alt="#Lockdown: Time to rethink how you collaborate with your remote media teams" width="950" height="480">It’s a team gameCreating and managing your own private media collection team has never been easier. Content creators can request to join your branded MojoReporter team from within the app – either as a contributor with the ability to upload digital media, or as a fully fledged team member with full access to the MojoReporter team dashboard. Like digital bouncers, group administrators can approve or deny all team requests, allowing you to restrict access and ensure the safety and exclusivity of your valuable digital media.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/555811.png" alt="#Lockdown: Time to rethink how you collaborate with your remote media teams" width="269" height="453">Central perksYour team has a client presentation in two hours’ time. You have the perfect photo in mind to complement your presentation but you’re still scratching around to find where you saved it. It’s time to do away with those external hard drives, flash drives or wherever else you store your digital media assets. The MojoReporter team dashboard means all mobile media can be centrally stored and displayed in a secure web environment with no limit to the amount of media your team can upload, allowing you and your team members to easily search for and download digital media in multiple sizes.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/555815.png" alt="#Lockdown: Time to rethink how you collaborate with your remote media teams" width="644" height="434">Size mattersInevitably, at some point you or a member of your team will be suffering from that very modern problem: Weak Internet Signal. But for journalists out in the field, the show must go on. MojoReporter allows you to resize and compress your large photos and videos before uploading, without compressing your digital media into a zip archive – meaning unlike other popular file-sharing platforms, media can be previewed in your browser before downloading.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/555816.png" alt="#Lockdown: Time to rethink how you collaborate with your remote media teams" width="269" height="453">Back-up planDisasters happen, but when it comes to the security of your digital media, there’s no need to lose any sleep.
