#SchoolUniformChallenge calls for South Africans to post throwback pictures of themselves in their school uniform on social media, tag two friends, encouraging them to donate R30 and keep the challenge growing. It kicked off on Monday, 11 May 2020 with posts by several macro-influencers to give reach upfront and ignite the challenge.

I had just buried my Mom but the smile I had was just to remind myself that she will always be there. The only time I stopped smiling was when we went for line up and the teachers would insist on “from Short to Tallest” and I would always be in front which made it hard for me to chat with my friends so I had no choice to be quiet. I look back now and think actually the reason why I was always in front was for me to lead by example �� to make sure everyone behaves while in lane��‍♀️ but that’s another story for another day. Guys this is for a really good cause, so please take up the Challenge! All the money goes to helping the kids from @tomorrow_trust have an education too. I nominate: @lynnehuysamen Here’s what you do: Post a your favourite school pic, with a little caption or story to go with it. Remember to make a R30 donation (link in bio) to help the kids from Tomorrow Trust. And, lay down the challenge to someone else! Thank you for your kindness @mimo_mokgosi A post shared by  The Tomorrow Trust ���� (@tomorrow_trust) on May 10, 2020 at 11:29pm PDT The key objective is to inspire each person who sees a post to donate just R30 or more to help raise R100,000. This will provide 1,200 of the Tomorrow Trust’s beneficiaries with connectivity so they can keep up their levels of learning over the school closures with access to free online educational resources. The campaign was led by FCB Joburg who partnered with Nfinity, Webfluential and theSALT. The campaign was facilitated by the Nahana Foundation, the corporate social investment arm of the Nahana Communications Group. The Nahana Foundation believes that creativity can change the world, and invests over R4m in professional services for pro-bono campaigns every year to assist non-profits with their marketing and branding efforts.
