Nominated for the Best Drama Television series at the Golden Globe® Awards, two years in a row, the broadcast of season one will lead directly into the second and third seasons of this gripping production. Based on the novels by Luke Jennings and written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Killing Eve centres on two distinctly different women. Eve (Sandra Oh) is a bored, whip-smart MI5 security officer whose desk-bound job doesn’t fulfil her fantasies of being a spy. Villanelle (Jodie Comer) is a mercurial, talented killer who clings to the luxuries her violent job affords her. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/553555.jpg" alt="Sandra Oh in her role as Eve" width="475" height="317">Sandra Oh in her role as Eve<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/553557.jpg" alt="Jodie Comer in her role as Villanelle" width="475" height="317">Jodie Comer in her role as VillanelleKilling Eve topples the typical spy-action thriller as these two fiercely intelligent women, equally obsessed with each other, go head to head in an epic game of cat and mouse.
