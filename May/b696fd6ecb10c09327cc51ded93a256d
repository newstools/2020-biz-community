Businesses across the world have managed to navigate their way through the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic by being innovative and finding ways to keep businesses operational during these trying times.  Dineplan Director Greg Whitfield said: “We saw the negative impact lockdown had on our clients with many closing their doors and others retrenching staff and that is how the idea of voucher plan came about. It is fantastic to also see how well it has been received by the consumers.”  Whitfield said the platform is available to any businesses in the country but the majority of businesses who have registered are from Gauteng and Western Cape. The vouchers are valid for three years after sale and can be redeemed when the businesses are open for operation.  “This is a very challenging time for particularly smaller businesses in our country and with innovative campaigns like this, it is evident that businesses are adapting to the evolving economic landscape. Listeners across our four stations have responded to the call and we will continue using our Primedia Broadcasting resources to be part of the solution during these trying times,” Geraint Crwys-Williams, Primedia Broadcasting chairperson, concluded.  Find your favourite business and buy a voucher so you can find them waiting for you after the lockdown is over.
