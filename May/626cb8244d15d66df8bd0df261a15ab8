We believe it is now more important than ever to spotlight creative and innovative brilliance during these trying times and recognise all of the outstanding work that is in consideration for a Pencil. D&AD is excited to announce the first shortlists today and look forward to sharing further shortlists across the coming weeks. Though we are disappointed that we are unable this year to display shortlisted work at D&AD Festival and celebrate the winners at the D&AD Awards ceremony, our exciting lineup of insight sessions, Q&As and Behind the Work series will continue to give exceptional creative thinking the platform it deserves.Simon Morris, senior director of marketing, at Adobe, commented: At Adobe, we’re passionate about enabling creativity for all and through our partnership with D&AD, are delighted to celebrate some of today’s best creative minds. Times like these show us the power of creativity, its impact on the way we think and live. We’re incredibly proud to have a hugely active creative community on Adobe Live, and can’t wait to use this platform to inspire and engage them even further with insights from the D&AD Awards and the D&AD Imagine Everything series.D&AD this year continues to platform the most exceptional work from the past 12 months, following the same rigorous judging process that holds creativity to the highest standards. Famously tough to win, there are no quotas for D&AD Awards, meaning that the number of awarded entries fluctuates each year. In some years, no Black Pencils - the highest creative accolade - are awarded. The highest ever awarded in one year currently stands at seven. Winning work will not only receive an esteemed D&AD Pencil, but it will also be featured in the D&AD Annual and online archive – the definitive guide for creatives all around the world.
