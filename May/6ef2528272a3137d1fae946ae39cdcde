The current health crisis has indeed forced us all out of our comfort zones, and innovative thinking and ideas is what will keep us moving. We had to focus on finding a way to still acknowledge all those who had entered the awards and also to celebrate the winners. We do hope that everyone enjoyed the show,” said Palesa Madumo, convenor of the Awards. 100% black woman-owned agency, The Riverbed, were announced as the biggest winners for the South African Campaign of the Year category, for their Underage Drinking campaign. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516459.jpg" alt="Riverbed's new Aware.org campaign draws attention to the real drinking age in South Africa" width="120" height="120">Riverbed's new Aware.org campaign draws attention to the real drinking age in South AfricaWe know that underage drinking is a problem, but we're quick to dismiss it as an issue only in other communities or a result of youthful curiosity or peer pressure...Issued by Riverbed 12 Sep 2019This year, the awards introduced some new and exciting categories.
