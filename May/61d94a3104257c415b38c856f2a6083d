Commenting on the current crisis affecting the industry, and of course the economy as a whole, Kandasamy believes that the comeback is always greater than the setback. "The status quo has changed. The rules of engagement have changed and are being rewritten. We are all forced to adapt, recreate, rebuild and unlearn. Together we will help rebuild the future we want for ourselves and our children using our God-given talent and superpower… creativity.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/555985.png" alt="Wearing the latest trend for 2020, a face mask." width="625" height="651">Wearing the latest trend for 2020, a face mask.1. Where do you live, work and play?Currently, due to Covid-19, all of the above at home. Waterfall Country Village Estate.2. What’s your claim to fame? Becoming creative partner at Grid Worldwide at the age of 27. 3. Describe your career so far. I obtained two degrees, one in multimedia and the other in graphic design. Directly after that, I walked through the doors of Grid Worldwide looking for a position. I would have taken anything, just to watch, learn and fill my passion for creativity and design. My internship lasted for nine months and nine months thereafter I became a partner. It was surreal to me but I am truly humbled and grateful to my business partners for believing in me and giving me the opportunity. 4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. I have a crazy vinyl collection. I love playing music on my turntable and dancing with my daughter. 5. What do you love about your industry? How free creativity allows us to be. I love that we can affect the world with our views and thinking. Creativity is so powerful. It is the catalyst for change, growth and inspires the human spirit with hope. During this time of uncertainty, it is a true testimony of how creativity can ignite positivity and bring an entire nation together as one. 6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. High paced creative ecstasy. Nothing is left undone. Everything happens in the now. 24 hours... go! 7. What are the tools of your trade? The tools are whatever we need to create. Even if it means creating the tools. Be the new engineer of creativity if you have to be. 8. Who is getting it right in your industry? Those who believe in creating true meaning and value. Those who are creating meaning for businesses and not briefs. The lines of creativity are blurred into so many industries. Those who are embracing all industries, understanding that they will inevitably affect what we do in the near future, will be the ones to lead.9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. The creative industry in South Africa is small. We don’t work together to create a better industry for all of us. Brand vs advertising vs digital, etc. The industry needs to work together to become a more integrated model that delivers on a single-minded thought for our clients. 10. What are you working on right now? Platform branding. A great internal campaign for Grid. Inverroche brand identity. 11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. I think the whole world is talking about the “new normal”. One catchphrase that has guided our decision-making through this hard time of Covid-19 has been: “people over profit”.12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? When I’m not forced or pressured into thinking. So the least expected places, driving around, lying in bed, having lunch. Why do you think so many great ideas were drawn on serviettes...13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I can dance like Michael Jackson. 14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? Somewhere in the middle. However, I am really enjoying learning new technology that helps me move from A-B at the speed of thought. 15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Pictures of my daughter Skylar and loads of design inspiration. 16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry?Never send your CV and hope someone will get back to you. Pitch up and demand some attention. Once you have their attention, give them a reason to keep it. Resilience and perseverance will pay off.Follow Kandasamy on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and/or LinkedIn.*Interviewed by Jessica Tennant.
