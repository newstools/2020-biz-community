The Future Kings’ sole purpose is to share and teach the principles of manhood and dream-building to young men. The programme helps young men realise their potential and envision a future where they are physically and emotionally equipped, responsible and productive members of society.The Future Kings programme aims to help young men from underprivileged backgrounds realise their potential. “There is a lack of mentors and leadership for boys in our society. We are passionate about helping them envision their future where they are physically and emotionally equipped, responsible and productive,” says Rams Mabote.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/554701.jpg" alt="Yaw Dwomoh" width="400" height="606">Yaw DwomohYaw Dwomoh, CEO of a well-known brand storytelling agency, commits to the programme as a focal CSI plan. “As Idea Hive, we are very delighted to be part of the programme and looking forward to being part of the journey to transforming the lives of young men. The programme’s objectives resonate with me personally and our value system as an organisation. I would like to play any role in my personal capacity to ensure Future Kings’ growth and sustainability.” Future Kings is Rams Mabote’s contribution to creating a safe and free space for at-risk young men, where they can have access to adult male confidants they can trust.“I want to play my role in saving just one boy from anger and desperation and, hopefully, in the process help them grow into beautiful, strong and independent males not angry with the world. The young men of our society hold great potential. The people of our society hold the power to develop it, so we value role models like Yaw, who continue to contribute positively to society and who uphold the values we want to teach these young men,” says Mabote.The alliance brings with it not only mentoring capacity, but the benefits of leading brand communications and creative expertise, which would enable Future Kings to clearly articulate its campaigns’ objectives on multiple platforms to its audience.About Idea Hive At Idea Hive, our team of curious, creative, driven and critical thinkers deliver brand storytelling solutions that will change how the market sees and experiences your brand.
