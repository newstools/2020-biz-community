Additionally, “Rooms” is now also visible in the calls menu on WhatsApp.Oddly, Messenger Rooms’ integration now gives WhatsApp users two video calling options. It may also shed light on the future of WhatsApp’s video calling prospects too.WhatsApp recently received a video and voice calling buff, increasing the maximum number of participants to eight. While Messenger Rooms allows up to 50, it’s likely that the WhatsApp call limit won’t be increased much further.Nevertheless, as we mentioned, it’s in beta, for now, so you probably won’t see Messenger Rooms in your WhatsApp for quite some time.
