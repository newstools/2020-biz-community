<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/557591.jpg" alt="Newzroom Afrika launches bold campaign" width="400" height="519">Newzroom Afrika has wasted no time, since its launch in May last year, in establishing itself as a fearlessly outspoken platform, where truth and transparency, however uncomfortable, are the mandate.“The foundation of our campaign is based on highlighting our channel platform, DStv channel 405, which has been turned into a room of truth. In Room 405, we welcome viewers to stay engaged and make themselves uncomfortable because ‘the truth isn’t always pleasant, but it’s always good’. The concept of Room 405 morphs easily from a newsroom into a decision room or an innovation room – any space where truth is at home,” says HOD: marketing and communications, Zamahlasela Gabela.This commitment to uncensored local perspectives – embodied in the channel’s brand promise of ‘Our News, Our Views’ – has ruffled more than a few feathers along the way, but Newzroom Afrika hasn’t shied away from the sometimes tricky conversations that are the lifeblood of the democratic spirit.The marketing campaign – the first since the channel’s inception – was conceived by creative agency The Odd Number.Sibusiso Sitole – the agency’s co-founder and group chief creative officer – says he was “most excited for people to finally get a sense of the energy and attitude of this brand.”Co-founder and group chief executive officer at The Odd Number, Xola Nouse adds that “In Newzroom Afrika, we saw partners whose entrepreneurial, independent and innovative approach to multi-media services resonates with that of our own in the communications sector. We saw an opportunity to create work that is truly African and is championed by a leading news outlet.”The campaign has already gone live on radio, to be followed in the coming days by TV, digital and print elements.
