The initiative was called Mothers of Industry; a play on the words captains of industry.         View this post on Instagram           Happy Mothers Day. Pt 1 of 4. This industry was raised by an invisible force: mothers. Always from a place of love, you were our first critic and our first supporter. And to the moms in the industry: you perform the most elaborate balancing act of our time. Moms have been our captains since day one, and without them our industry would not be what it is today.

It’s important to honour the crucial role that women play in the industry while celebrating the mothers that quite literally raised Grid.

Ordinarily, we wish mothers in the agency a good day. This time around, we took a deeper look and decided to take it a level up and show appreciation to those who gave birth to the talent. It has both been eye-opening and endearing, connecting us all even more.”         View this post on Instagram           Happy Mothers Day. Pt 4 of 4.

The victory and feeling of coming out of this crisis in a better mental state itself are what it has become, for me, my real driving force.”
