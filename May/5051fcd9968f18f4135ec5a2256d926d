<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/554373.jpg" alt="#KagisoRadioTeachers campaign takes teaching to the airwaves" width="625" height="434">“Kagiso Trust has long believed that education is the key to overcoming poverty,” says the organisation’s CEO, Mankodi Moitse, “Over the past 16 years we have created education programmes structured to have the highest impact and greatest sustainability. Our work in the Free State is testament to that.”Radio lessons will be hosted for an hour, once a day, from Monday to Sunday on Capricorn FM, Sekhukhune FM and Tubatse FM. The Limpopo MEC for Education, Polly Boshielo said, “Crafted lessons will be offered by expert appointed subject teachers with an excellent track record in the subject that they offer. These are the teachers who recorded 80% and more pass rate in the subjects that they have been teaching since 2017. We believe that their expert content knowledge will benefit more than 80% of the current grade 12 learners in Limpopo.”COO of Kagsio Trust, Themba Mola said, “Grade 12 learners have already lost more than 30 days since the lockdown coupled with the possibility of losing another month if the phase-in model announced by Minister becomes a 1st of June return. This model of mediating learning will strengthen teaching and learning in the absence of face-to-face conventional classes.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2004/548613-120x120.jpg?2" alt="tookapic via" width="120" height="120">SABC to air school lessonsThe educational programme is scheduled to start on Thursday, 9 April and will broadcast across three SABC TV channels and 13 radio stations, with online support...8 Apr 2020Capricorn FM will focus on MST subjects (Mathematics, Sciences and Technologies), including Mathematics, Mathematical Literacy, Physical Sciences, Life Sciences and Agricultural Sciences. “These are the subjects that are highly enrolled and determine the standard and quality of education offered in Limpopo province. Currently, the main subject of the five, that still poses a serious challenge in the province is Mathematics, whose performance is still below the threshold,” said Mola.The other 7 non-MST subjects will be broadcast by the community radio stations in the both Sekhukhune East and South education districts. They include English FAL, Sepedi HL, Accounting, Business Studies, Economics, History and Geography. Each live broadcast lesson will last for an hour per day during and after the lockdown period. The first 30 minutes is allocated to the teacher to mediate learning and the other 30 minutes will be reserved to the learners to interact with the teacher through questions or comments. Content will largely cover term 1 and 2 scope and will be supplemented by face-to-face contact sessions after learners have returned to school. “In a province as large as Limpopo, radio is the perfect platform to reach most learners,” says Moitse. “This is about inclusivity. It is about access to information. It is about gathering together around a radio like we once all did. This is the new normal. We call upon everyone to support the radio lessons and #KagisoRadioTeachers – local teachers, broadcasting across Limpopo, straight into the homes of learners.”Details: Capricorn FM will broadcast lessons 5-6pm Monday to Friday on the Just Drive show.  And every Saturday and Sunday 9-10am on The Saturday Breakfast and The Sunday Restoration respectively.  Podcasts will be available on the station’s website and learners from other provinces can listen via livestreamingFor more information please visit the following stakeholder websites for schedule information on classes: www.Kagiso.co.za www.edu.limpopo.gov.za www.capricornfm.co.za
