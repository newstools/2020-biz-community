These eight points cover the growth of OTT (over-the-top) service subscribers, expected to increase to 31.7% in 2022, the impact of video, the ability to personalise and segment messages thanks to the use of data, the importance of offering an omnichannel experience across all devices, and lastly, the ability to drive results.The Advanced TV guide can be downloaded here.David Barnard, managing director for VDX.tv in South Africa, explains the reasons behind the decision of creating this guide: “At VDX.tv we have identified a high demand from the market to learn more about the Advanced TV. In general, among marketers very few feel confident in their knowledge of the advanced TV space and they feel unprepared to make marketing decisions that include CTV in their strategic plans. Moreover, with more OTT entrants into the South Africa market, we set out to develop a guide to answering all questions and concerns, and to arm professionals with the knowledge to advertise across all screens and channels with complete confidence.”Moreover, if we add the fact that we live in a multi-screen world, where consumers move seamlessly between devices and increasingly require a high content personalisation, it is necessary to adapt and consider new communication channels to ensure that brands are wherever consumers are.VDX.tv is a global advertising technology company that is transforming the way brands connect with relevant audiences in today’s converging video landscape.
