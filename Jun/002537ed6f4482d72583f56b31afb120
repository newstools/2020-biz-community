Recommended by evaluators and reviewed by the Gold Quill Awards chair, vice chair and past chair, the Best of the Best winners represent the very best entries seen across the globe. The 2020 Gold Quill Awards Committee felt that the video pushed the boundaries of what can be done by combining local languages, storytelling and compelling ideas across multiple media, while involving the audience in collaboration with the project. The committee commented as follows: "This entry showed clear impact not only on the project, but on ethical business practice within the frame of environmental concern. The video and map used showed very professional and innovative execution - we view this as an example for others to follow.  Well done!" The video is aimed at encouraging participants in Sappi’s Khulisa Enterprise and Supplier development programme, to become sustainable participants in the forestry value chain. Rather than just remaining as subsistence farmers focusing on small crops of timber, the video - which is narrated in isiZulu by SA celebrity storyteller Gcina Mhlophe - tells the story of how a grower can secure a future for her grandchildren by becoming self-sufficient through training and mentorship, provided by Sappi Khulisa. The video was produced by Zelda Schwalbach, communications manager for Sappi Forests, along with a team from Sappi Khulisa, led by Dutliff Smith, development manager, Sappi Forests. The production company was Danegerous Pictures, under the direction of Dane Maxwell. The theme song was composed and produced by Phatjam Productions and was sung by Durban girl and former SA Idols top eight contestant,  Nosihe Zulu.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/561912.jpg" alt="From left to right: Marcel Sapet, Dane Maxwell, Gcina Mhlophe, Zelda Schwalbach" width="255" height="157">From left to right: Marcel Sapet, Dane Maxwell, Gcina Mhlophe, Zelda Schwalbach<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/561914.jpg" alt="The crew on set" width="255" height="157">The crew on setAwards committee chair Ed Kamrin, SCMP, said of this year’s winners: “Recent events have highlighted that more than ever, we live in an interconnected world.
