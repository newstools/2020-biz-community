Fined $5000 every time he stepped onto the court wearing the Air Jordan 1s, Michael Jordan and Nike completely transformed sports and marketing. Over a single season, Jordan was fined $410 000 (Nike paid the fines) but the endorsement was worth $7 000 000 over five years. After this deal, sports stars were paid exponentially more for their endorsements, and sneakers became a statement piece of those agreements. Michael was more than just the GOAT, he was a folk hero for his rebelliousness and for not succumbing to league pressure.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/560931.png" alt="What is shaping culture?
