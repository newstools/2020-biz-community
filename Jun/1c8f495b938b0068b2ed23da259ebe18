Their client base includes both local and international big hitters such as Tencent Africa, Capitec Bank, Discovery Channel, MultiChoice and Primedia.The acquisition of Swipe iX means that New Media now combines decades of storytelling expertise with solid, scalable tech solutions.New Media CEO Aileen Lamb says: “Bringing Swipe iX into the fold is a game changer. It allows us to deepen our innovative and holistic offering with our existing blue-chip client base and creates compelling opportunities for new clients and our own brands.“As relevant, quality content that creates an emotional connection plays an increasingly powerful role in customer experience, so the intelligent integration of content and platform becomes more crucial. Creating an efficient, tied-together and measurable content journey right up to – and beyond – the point of sale means that the content works as hard as possible and offers maximum value to customers.“New Media has always stood for specialised storytelling content and can now marry this with the best-quality business intelligence and tech. In the coming months and years, there will be a stronger focus on using smart tech to integrate relevant content into the customer experience. This is particularly true in a post-pandemic business, where clients will need integrated digital-first solutions that deliver value to their customers as well as proof that the content makes a meaningful commercial impact in their business. New Media has played a leading role in growing our industry for over 20 years and this acquisition helps us to continue that tradition.”Swipe iX MD and co-founder Leo Redelinghuys says: “We are ecstatic to be partnering with New Media. Swipe has always been about delivering world-class solutions to our clients by building products that truly make a difference in the day-to-day lives of customers. The opportunity to provide cutting-edge digital solutions at an even larger scale, together with the powerful storytelling that the talented New Media team brings, creates a very strong dynamic that will greatly benefit both companies’ clients. Combining the strengths of our two distinct yet complementary businesses will enable us to deliver the sort of groundbreaking innovations that will push the envelope of what is possible.”Swipe iX is 100% owned by Media24, of which New Media is a wholly owned subsidiary, but will continue to trade under its established name.Aileen says: “Not only does Swipe iX offer a fantastic depth of skills and experience, but they have immense speed and an ability to adapt to the ever-changing needs of our clients. There’s also a great cultural fit with New Media – we live by the mantra of being brave and the Swipe iX team bring that in spades. This is a giant leap in New Media’s continued evolution. We’re ready to supercharge the content marketing offering in SA through this acquisition!”
