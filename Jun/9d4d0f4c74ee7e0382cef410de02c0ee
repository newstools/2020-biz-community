Thanks to the #FreeYourFuture competition, Makehma will now receive her CDW certificate, which will open many doors for her. According to Lindiwe Mtwentula, OFM marketing manager, student debt is a huge obstacle preventing many students from moving forward in life.“A student cannot graduate until all outstanding accounts at the higher education institution have been settled. As a result, many students cannot graduate despite passing all their subjects and qualifying for the degree, because of crippling student debt.  This is why we created the #FreeYourFuture competition – to help one person to finally graduate and embark on their career path.”This is the second year that the #FreeYourFuture competition took place. To be considered for financial assistance, persons between the ages of 18 and 35 had to email their contact details, motivation, account, proof of enrolment and a copy of their IDs to the station.
