As a nonprofit organisation, it’s our mission to support the global creative community, and we believe elevating and recognising the best work in the world is a way to inspire creatives and bring some good news to the industry right now.“The One Show For All” theme reflects the organisation’s quest to rally unity within the creative community as it deals with work furloughs and larger societal issues.“It’s clearly not a time for celebration as usual, but recognising amazing work is a shared positive experience,” said Swanepoel. “As the industry’s largest global program for celebrating creativity this year, The One Show 2020 can serve as the platform and driver for bringing the industry together.”Of note is the strength of this year’s winning non-profit and corporate social responsibility entries, which demonstrate the best face of advertising: great work doesn’t just sell products, it’s also able to address important issues and change perceptions, behaviours and lives for the better.The One Show Archives and Creative RankingThe One Show Archives and Creative Ranking will serve as the authoritative global resource this year for the creative community to gauge trends and see the best work in the world.In early March, The One Club announced the switch from in-person to online judging for The One Show 2020 and ADC 99th Annual Awards. The change allowed jury members from around the world to continue to review entries in safe environments and enabled both awards shows to maintain global integrity and quality to the judging process. The One Club awards shows each have their distinct focus. The One Show judges focus on creativity of ideas and quality of execution, while ADC Annual Awards juries maintain their historic concentration as the champion for craft, design and innovation.In-person judging, Creative Week and The One Show, ADC Annual Awards and Young Ones Student Awards ceremonies in New York will resume in 2021.
