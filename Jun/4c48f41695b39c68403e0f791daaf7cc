He is also a musician and an astute businessman with his own clothing label, Nay Maps Clothing.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/561902.jpg" alt="DJ Lamiez Holworthy" width="300" height="448">DJ Lamiez HolworthyListeners who tuned in on Saturday, 20 June joined in conversation with Meso and popular South African DJ, television personality and presenter Lamiez Holworthy, when they tipped their hats to the legends of lockdown – those whose creativity knows no bounds.Gordon’s Gin brand manager, Kayla Hendricks, explains that the local  entertainment industry is among the hardest hit by the Covid-19 lockdown. “We know how difficult it has been for all – and particularly our entertainers in this case – to stay positive in the face of so much uncertainty. We know the difference a helping hand can make when it matters most. We also know how incredibly challenging it can be to clear the path towards one’s legacy and to remind oneself of the passion and commitment you had, after fielding a significant curveball. This is the impetus behind this conversation series and is also why Gordon’s Gin is giving away R40,000 in funding to help entertainers and their industry groups clear the path again.’’ ‘’Gordon’s Gin is a brand that prides itself on its 250-year legacy, and celebrates those building theirs. That is why we have partnered with these legendary entertainers to provide support and guidance to those ready and willing to listen. It’s our salute to the legends in the entertainment industry who keep on creating and contributing in these trying times,’’ she adds. To participate in the Gordon’s #BeALegend challenge and stand a chance to win a cash contribution towards a growing legacy, members of the entertainment industry need simply choose to step ‘out of the ordinary and into the legendary,’ by sharing their story on the competition posts on the Gordon’s Gin Facebook page.
