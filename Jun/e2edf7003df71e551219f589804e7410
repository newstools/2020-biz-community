No one could ever have planned for something on this scale. Everyone is trying their best. I am so proud of our government's fast and tough responses that were taken. Yes, some could have been faster and others haven't been thought through, but everyone is working as hard as they can. It’s so easy to sit of the sidelines and complain..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the agency and creative industry or economy as a whole.MetropolitanRepublic has always been a bit of a nomadic company. We’ve been working in over 12 countries in Africa for over 10 years now, deploying fast responder teams to multiple countries simultaneously. So, we’ve lived with remote working, 'pop-up hotel' agencies and remote online, all-day workgroups with clients for quite a while. The impact has not really been too disruptive for our teams.Creatively, it’s an interesting thing. Lockdown does the opposite for the creative mind, I believe. It ‘opens up’ to new possibilities, new collaborations and irrevocable change, overnight.However, with that said, I think it’s a time of natural selection for companies, brands and whole categories to adapt or die.

As the world resets, we’ll see winners and losers. We can’t standstill. We can’t rely on old tricks. Our time has come, as the crazy ones, to create new rules of engagement and new brand behaviours. For brands to win, they will have to become more resourceful, more agile, more empathetic, less self-serving, more community-minded, more enduring and more endearing, and definitely more purpose-led.Likewise, the same applies to agencies and their thinking..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How are you navigating ‘physical distancing’ while keeping your team close-knit and aligned and your clients happy?We’ve never been closer. The pandemic has stripped away any remaining formality. It’s the great leveller that has brought out the best (and the worst) in us, as we bond through technology and vulnerability, to realise that physical distance has cultivated more connection, more humility and more laughs – as much as with colleagues as with clients. I think we are all becoming more solution-orientated and are all working harder and quicker to produce and roll out solutions.   .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Has this global crisis changed your view of the future of advertising/marketing in any way? Any trends you’ve seen emerge as a result of the crisis?We can now classify brands as denialists, opportunists, realists, philanthropists or activists, and what we need most right now, are activists.  Lucky we’ve always attracted purpose-led brands and this crisis is a seminal time for activist brands to thrive..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Your key message to fellow industry folk?Make sure your brands give more right now than they take.
