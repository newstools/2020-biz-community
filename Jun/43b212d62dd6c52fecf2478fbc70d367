We felt that with our suite of products we could really push out video OTT that would allow for remote broadcasting, management of those video assets and then, most importantly, the ability for clubs to monetise this content via web or app properties – so we really looked at this holistically in a way that would provide solutions to the challenges sports clubs are facing in the current climate.We really looked at this holistically in a way that would provide solutions to the challenges sports clubs are facing in the current climate - PT SportSuite CEO Rich Cheary“As sports fans ourselves, we understand the role that sport brings to people’s lives and this motivated us to provide a solution that would allow clubs playing matches in front of empty stands to broadcast matches directly to the fans.”Does your organisation have a need to broadcast live or on-demand video content direct to your digital community.
