The Interactive Advertising Bureau South Africa (IAB SA) Digital Influencer Marketing Committee, formed in October 2019, has been working towards generating clearly defined and commonly agreed guidelines, standards, best practice, definitions and benchmarks, in collaboration with IAB Global, to enable the media and marketing industry to make better digital decisions in this growing segment of the industry.“As part of the process to develop a common set of definitions and expand into secondary projects on best practice, measurement and benchmarks, the IAB SA Digital Influencer Marketing Committee invites the media and marketing industry, as well as broader stakeholders in the digital influencer marketing community, to participate in this survey,” says Paula Hulley, IAB SA CEO. “The objective is to better understand the current market management of digital influencer marketing to reach their customers in a relevant and meaningful way.”Says Stephane Rogovsky, CEO and Founder R-Squared Digital and the Committee Lead: “Based on the results from the survey, we will get a much clearer understanding of the current landscape and expectations, broken down by category of industry player and job function, which will be used as groundwork to start the analysis. Once we have collated all of the results, we will be integrating this with data that we are sourcing independently in order to report back on the results and ask for industry input. We are aiming for this to be ready in the next couple of months.”The survey will take a maximum of five minutes to complete and is available here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/IABInflMeasurement.Please complete the survey by Friday 26 June 2020.
