Lanseria International, meanwhile, has a 3m x 9m screen and two 1.5m x 6.9m screens, reaching an audience of approximately 193,500 monthly. The new ORTIA screen, in turn, will be seen by approximately 508,000 travellers a month.The extended Visionet digital network now offers advertisers the ability to embark on a digital campaign across the three airport locations while communicating their brand messaging to over one million affluent decision makers monthly.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/562441.jpg" alt="Airport Ads bolsters Visionet network with massive OR Tambo screen" width="950" height="633">“The addition of Visionet at OR Tambo International is notable, as it significantly ramps up our digital offering while adding over 500,000 travellers monthly to the audience the network previously engaged,” says Mzi Deliwe, deputy CEO of PMG and head of Airport Ads. “Not only is Visionet able to deliver the speed and quality that digital out of home technology offers, but due to its impressive size, also the opportunity for brands to achieve high impact and make a lasting impression with travellers.”Audience data Key to Visionet’s effectiveness is the quality of the audience the Airport Ads platform is able to deliver.According to the research cited earlier, it’s an affluent audience, with 39% earning in excess of R500,000 annually. Further, 40% of high LSM consumers travel through airports monthly, whilst roughly 31% are business travellers. Approximately 80% of this audience is aged between 30 and 50, and roughly 58% are frequent flyers. It’s a valuable audience – with access to larger amounts of disposable spend – and it’s one that spends more time exposed to media than in any other out of home environment, with an average minimum dwell period of 75 minutes in the airport environment. Adding to the impact of this platform is the fact that this audience is a captive one in a location that affords brands zero tune-out.With its size, prime locations, impact and desirable audiences, the Visionet network makes for a desirable solution for brands. Particularly brands that understand that digital mediums and technology-based solutions are becoming paramount in staying connected and relevant to a range of targeted and desirable consumer segments.To find out more about the Limitless Solutions Airport Ads® can offer your brand, contact airportads@provantage.co.zabRev('brev-1d729430-d867-4fff-bc8f-a5e6704a19cf', '>a/\<az.oc.egatnavorp@sdatropria>"az.oc.egatnavorp;46#&sdatropria:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or call 0861 776 826.
