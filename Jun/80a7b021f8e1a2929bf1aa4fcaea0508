Mo Abudu's incursion into this arena as film and television producer has been especially stimulating. It becomes part of one's sense of achievement if one has contributed, however minutely, to the creation of an enabling environment.Says Lola Shoney:I was thrilled when Mo contacted me about making a show out of my novel The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives. I’d turned down so many offers but this one felt right. It was an opportunity to see my work in the hands of a woman who pursued excellence in Africa in the same way that I did. I grew to trust her very quickly, so when she told me about the possibility of working with Netflix, I was overjoyed. Soon, people everywhere will have access to the story of Baba Segi. And that is more that I could have asked for as a writer.”
