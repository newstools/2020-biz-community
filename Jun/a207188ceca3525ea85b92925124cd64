The Prisms are awarded to individuals, students, consultancies, companies, government organisations and NGOs that have successfully fused strategy with creativity and professionalism to achieve the best communications and business objectives in their public relations campaigns. The awards are currently in their 23rd year and for 2020, new categories have been introduced.For the first time in its 23-year history, Africa’s most sought-after awards show in the public relations and communications industry was hosted on Friday, 15 May 2020 via online streaming due to concerns of the spread of Covid-19 in the country. Bata South Africa  and Take Note Reputation Management worked together in selecting their first ever Bata Youth Board of Directors (YBOD). The board of trendsetters, aged between eight and 16, gave Bata an inside glimpse of youth insight and market desirability. This board also served as a learning platform as it exposed the youth to real-life business experiences.Take Note Reputation Management developed an integrated campaign that included coverage via print, digital, broadcast and social media channels. The use of these channels saw the campaign exceed all of its performance deliverables. “Bata saw the Youth Board of Directors as a resource for fresh, new perspectives to delivering a vibrant and creative ‘youth-appeal’ fashion philosophy, to all young South Africans,” says Michael Wyatt Bata South Africa country manager. “We are grateful to the team at Take Note for all their hard work and dedication and for bringing this campaign to life. The achievement of a silver award at this year’s Prism awards further solidifies the success of the campaign,” added Swastika Juggernath, Bata South Africa marketing manager.  Bata South Africa also wishes to thank the members of 13th Floor, Dream Builders and Blossom Insights who formed part of the team for this campaign.
