Pencil winners will be announced on 9, 16 June and 8 September. A full list of dates can be found below. While hosting a 2020 ceremony is not possible due to coronavirus, D&AD will be announcing this year’s Pencil winners via their website and in a social campaign designed by Studio Dumbar. Tim Linsday, D&AD chairman, commented: We are proud to recognise the exceptional work from the past year that demonstrates the unlimited potential of creative thinking. After each Shortlist announcement, it becomes increasingly clear that 2020 is proving to be a strong year for work in our industry. We look forward to announcing the Pencil winners and subsequent Shortlists across the coming weeks, and continuing to spotlight creative excellence in a time of great uncertainty.D&AD this year continues to platform the most exceptional work from the past 12 months, following the same rigorous judging process that holds creativity to the highest standards. Famously tough to win, there are no quotas for D&AD Awards, meaning that the number of awarded entries fluctuates each year. In some years, no Black Pencils - the highest creative accolade - are awarded. The highest ever awarded in one year currently stands at seven. Winning work will not only receive an esteemed D&AD Pencil, it will also be featured in the D&AD Annual and online archive – the definitive guide for creatives all around the world.
