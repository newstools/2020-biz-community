A full list of dates can be found below. While hosting a 2020 ceremony is not possible due to coronavirus, D&AD will be announcing this year’s Pencil winners via their website and in a social campaign designed by Studio Dumbar.To celebrate the winners in the absence of a physical awards show, D&AD and Studio Dumbar have created a custom Instagram Stories augmented reality filter that reveals virtual Wood, Graphite, Yellow and White D&AD Pencils to the winners. While they can’t take to the stage this year to accept their Pencils, winners can enjoy a moment of celebration by being virtually awarded through the D&AD Pencil Unboxing filter, accessible through a private link that is being emailed to the winners.Tim Lindsay, D&AD chairman, commented: We are excited to announce the Pencil winners across the Advertising, Culture and Design categories. Our juries were blown away by the high calibre of work entered this year, meaning it has been another challenging yet rewarding process of selecting the 2020 Pencil winners. Our industry never ceases to push boundaries, challenge expectations and adapt to new circumstances. D&AD is delighted to be able to continue celebrating and stimulating the best work, even in these most trying of times.D&AD this year continues to platform the most exceptional work from the past 12 months, following the same rigorous judging process that holds creativity to the highest standards. Famously tough to win, there are no quotas for D&AD Awards, meaning that the number of awarded entries fluctuates each year. In some years, no Black Pencils - the highest creative accolade - are awarded. The highest ever awarded in one year currently stands at seven. Winning work will not only receive an esteemed D&AD Pencil, but it will also be featured in the D&AD Annual and online archive – the definitive guide for creatives all around the world.
