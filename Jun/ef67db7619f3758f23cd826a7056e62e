Following President Ramaphosa’s address on 24 May 2020, the #Level3Restrictions hashtag emerged and has since reached over 25 million people on social media. Since then, trending themes related to this hashtag have included:‘bottle store rush’, which refers to the overall feeling of mass purchasing of alcohol at bottle stores from 1 June 2020‘home consumption’, which refers to the sale of alcohol only being permitted for consumption at home under Level 3 regulations‘sale of cigarettes’, which refers to the prohibition of tobacco products, like cigarettes, under Level 3 regulations‘justification’, which refers to a recent tweet from the political party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), which called out Minister Dlamini-Zuma on her reasoning for the continued ban on tobacco productsIt appears that Dlamini-Zuma lied to South Africans in her justification for the continued ban on the sale of cigarettes & other tobacco products. If this is indeed the case, then Ramaphosa has no choice but to fire her. -@jsteenhuisen#Level3Restrictionshttps://t.co/Ct88isdJCe— Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) May 29, 2020 As the month of May comes to a close, we now look to start the month of June with new rules and regulations in place, and no doubt that South Africans continue to share their woes and wins on social media. From a new Miss South Africa coming soon, to the slow return of ‘back to normal’ living amidst a global crisis, the South African social media landscape will surely be one to document and share it all.
