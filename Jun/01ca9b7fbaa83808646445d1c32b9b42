This has become a very important audience for brands to invest in and ones that are able to reach and appeal to them stand to benefit a great deal in the future. This is a tech-driven generation who is breaking all the rules of how things are traditionally done and are doing things their own way and it’s important for brands to understand this. Influencer marketing is the new ‘wave’ as centennials would refer to it in urban street colloquial terms and brands that are doing it right are reaping the benefits of being able to influence consumer behaviour and sway them to buy into their offering.One of the reasons spaces like Braamfontein Johannesburg have become so popular is because it’s transformed into a creative arts hub and a melting pot for young creators in fashion, music and arts space who are moving urban youth culture forward.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/533825-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#BizTrends2020: Retail and Gen Z in 2020 - who they are and what they want" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2020: Retail and Gen Z in 2020 - who they are and what they wantAlthough this generation has less spending power than Millennials, it is estimated that 40% of consumer spending will be attributed to Generation Z consumers in 2020...By Semona Pillay 9 Jan 2020In the past, we’ve seen brands like Power Play Energy Drink through their ‘Griffin Sessions’ Events take advantage of this growing creative space. We’ve also seen brands like Absolut Vodka follow suit and playing in the space at an even larger scale through the “Absolut One Source Live” events. Nando’s is also an active player in the space and has been for numerous years through their sponsorship for the annual Nando’s ‘Basha Uhuru’ Event in partnership with Constitution Hill and their various ongoing programs and initiatives in support for local arts scene and artists.2020 has seen the creative niche arts space become even ‘cooler’ because of its endorsement by urban centennials who are essentially tastemakers and drivers for ‘cool’. Events like the Annual Cotton Fest which incorporate the arts, fashion and music hosted at The Station in Newtown and already on its 2nd installation have become the epitome and essence of urban youth culture and a reflection of what Gen-Z is all about.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477620-120x120.png?1" alt="Kwesta, AKA, and 80 unique acts to perform at Riky Rick's Cotton Fest" width="120" height="120">Kwesta, AKA, and 80 unique acts to perform at Riky Rick's Cotton FestCombining his love of music and fashion, Riky Rick will present his inaugural Cotton Fest at The Station in Newtown, Johannesburg on 2 February 2019...15 Jan 2019I've identified three young urban creatives we believe are a personification of the new ‘cool’.
