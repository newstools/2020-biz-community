Advice for first-time entrants" width="625" height="325">No matter you’re a one-man agency or large creative consultancy, the Loeries celebrates creative excellence and anyone can win. With entries free this year the net has been cast even wider and the Loeries expect even more diversity and texture of ideas. Here are five tips on putting together a winning entry.  1. The jury is your target audience – ensure your work stands out and explain the important nuances of your entry. The jury has tons of entries to go through 2. Know your metrics – all entries are judged on the same criteria so make certain you have all the five criteria the judges are looking for i.e innovation; quality of execution; relevance to the brand; relevance to the target audience and relevance to the chosen medium 3. Start with a good idea – great ideas win awards, make sure you build on the strengths of your idea 4. Explain your entry - the Loeries is a regional award and judges are looking for strong regional creative work. Make sure the judges understand the relevance of your work: the cultural and geographical nuances, the impact and reach 5.
