It wasn't an easy decision for me as I've loved my tenure as Head of Post Grad these past four and a half years. Post Grad has been a very happy home for me. However, I felt it was time to explore a bigger challenge and to contribute more to the greater good of the Durban campus. I was one of the original staff members of this campus in 2013, and I've watched the institution grow up through the rubble. From my early days as Production Course Administrator and Screenwriting lecturer, I've always put my heart and soul into developing the students to become the best they could be. I now look forward to continue this role in a larger way, and to enable the staff, as well as our students, to reach their full potential, as filmmakers, playmakers, academics and human beings. I hope to make Afda Durban a creative hub of excellence and aim to specialise in certain areas, but - most importantly - I want to make the campus the place everyone wants to be. I'm under no illusion that this is an easy task, but I'm going to do my best in this endeavour," says Janet.Janet has written over 20 feature-length screenplays as well as numerous short films, written and produced six stage plays (and directed two) and taken each one to the National Arts Festival, with funding from the National Arts Council.
