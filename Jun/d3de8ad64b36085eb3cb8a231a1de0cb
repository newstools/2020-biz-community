The newspaper sparked a nationwide movement to normalise LGBTQ with a special Out and Proud classifieds section.Employee Engagement Award, rewarding a purpose-led strategy that is consistent both inside and outside an organisation, has been awarded to FP7 McCann Dubai for The Gift of Mom campaign for children's retailer Babyshop, which increased brand affinity through a multi-channel Mother's Day initiative centred around breast cancer in the United Arab Emirates.Sustainability Award, for a brand that has replaced a strategy or business practice with a more sustainable alternative and can prove that it has contributed to long-term brand health, has been awarded to Santa Clara for Native Bees, a campaign for Brazilian craft beer brand Cervejeria Colorado, which highlighted the problem of bee extinction to publicise its production chain and brand values.An eminent jury of 18 agency- and client-side industry professionals, selected the following full list of winners: Grand Prix:The Country Pub Project · Airbnb · Airbnb Creative, APAC · AustraliaGold:Out & Proud - India Comes Out of the Closet · The Times of India · Bennett Coleman & Co.
