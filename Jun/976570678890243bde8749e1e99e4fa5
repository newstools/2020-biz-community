The BrandZ strong brands portfolios continued to outperform the market, including the S&P 500 and MSCI World Index, and even in the current crisis dipped less than the global average. Charles Foster, CEO Africa and Middle East, Insights Division, Kantar comments: “Insights from BrandZ demonstrate yet again the ability of strong brands to immunise companies against the effects of economic shocks, even ones as massive as a global pandemic. With the BrandZ South Africa and the first BrandZ Middle East Most Valuable Brands study due for release later in the year, will our continents brands’ show the same degree of resilience in the face of adversity?” BrandZ™ portfolios vs S&P500 and MSCI World: April 2006 – April 2020 <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/563458.jpg" alt="2020 BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Ranking reveals growing power and influence of technology" width="810" height="307" rel="">click to enlargeThe ranking uses valuation data incorporating stock price performance from April 2020 to reflect the impact of Covid-19. Against a backdrop of uncertainty, those companies that have consistently invested in longer-term marketing and in building strong brands have managed to stave off the worst of the crisis. Prior to the global pandemic, total brand value of the Top 100 brands was set to increase by 9%.Amazon maintained its position as the world’s most valuable brand, growing 32% to $415.9bn. Having first entered the BrandZ Global Top 100 Most Valuable Brands ranking in 2006, Amazon’s value grew by almost $100bn this year and accounts for a third of the Top 100’s total growth.Technology brands continued to dominate the top of the ranking, representing over a third (37%) of brand value in the Top 100 and growing overall by 10%. Apple maintained its position as the second most valuable global brand (+14%, $352.2bn) while Microsoft regained the no. 3 position (+30%, $326.5bn) ahead of Google (+5%, $323.6bn) at no. 4, due to the growth of its cloud-enabled workplace ecosystem that incorporates Office365 and Microsoft Teams, allowing people to maintain ‘business as usual’ during the lockdown. Asian brands represented a quarter of the Top 100 brands, including 17 Chinese brands. Alibaba (+16%, no. 6, $152.5bn) was the most valuable Chinese brand with Internet services giant, Tencent (+15%, no. 7, $151bn) one place behind. This year’s BrandZ Top 100 showed that innovation and creativity are key drivers of growth as people spend more time online. One of the most exciting new brands, short video-sharing social network TikTok (no. 79, $16.9bn) was the highest new entry this year, offering light-hearted, entertaining user-generated content. “Brand building, at the core of BrandZ, continues making sense and cents as a business investment, and it is phenomenal to see growth in spite of the economic ravages of Covid-19. A global perspective for marketers is critical, as sometimes we can be too locally introspective, forgetting that our consumers are informed, involved and inspired by global brands. How exciting to see that innovation and creativity is driving the bottom line, demonstrating that is not just about data and tech, but the impact of the human spirit in the mix. TikTok shows us that brands do not even have to infuse creativity themselves but instead, as an enabler of creativity, allows the brand to connect with the hearts and minds of people,” says Ivan Moroke, CEO South Africa, Insights Division, Kantar.BrandZ™ Top 10 Most Valuable Global Brands 2020 <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/563463.jpg" alt="2020 BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Ranking reveals growing power and influence of technology" width="810" height="431" rel="">click to enlargeThe retail sector showed strong performance, growing the fastest (21%) in brand value driven by the major e-commerce players.
