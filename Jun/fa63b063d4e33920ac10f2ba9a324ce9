I am looking forward to creating impactful, behaviour changing work with the team.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1802/429594-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#IMC2018: The science of how brands grow" width="120" height="120">#IMC2018: The science of how brands growA popular track at this year's IMC Conference was that of creative and big idea creation, and a talk that really struck a cord, so to speak, was BBDO South Africa's CEO Boniswa Pezisa's on the power of breakthrough creativity and the role it plays in triggering emotions to communicate effectively...By Jessica Tennant 16 Feb 2018Marking the agency's 26th anniversary, Pezisa pays tribute to their founders at this time, “Our agency was born 26 years ago today. At the height of the state of emergency. A time when our country was in a lockdown of a different kind. Only Mike Schalit and Keith Shipley – the eternal optimists – would see it fit to create and build something new against that kind of backdrop. Mike and Keith will keep sailing their ships of creative for good. They still have so much to give."In the middle of a global crisis, a milestone anniversary, and a significant appointment, I wanted to remind you that the agencies that will triumph are the fearless ones, the ones who will do things differently, who will innovate and re-innovate and move on. It is not lost on me either that at this time, Net#work BBDO will be led by two women. Feminine power. A streetwise girl from Zola who doesn’t suffer fools and a creative that is much more: a tireless creator.
