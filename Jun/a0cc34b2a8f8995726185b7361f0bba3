They're a ghostly cast of living monsters that defy the convention of life on Earth as we know it.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/562198.jpg" alt="The champs are back, and they're ready to chomp!" width="950" height="534">Shark vs Surfer Tuesday, 14 July at 6pm on National Geographic Wild Surfers aren’t the only athletes in the water; they share the playing field with the most powerful players below surface, and often, they’re no match for the real danger among the waves.

The never-before-seen behaviour causes a complete perspective shift on a creature Johnson has spent his life studying. To make sense of the event, he follows humpback whales on their migration, mapping places that may make them vulnerable and takes a new look at great white sharks to discover how and why they become whale killers.
