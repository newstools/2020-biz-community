Marketing costs are soaring year-on-year and while companies are downsizing and retrenching staff, all hope is not lost as organisations of all sizes can still reach their audiences through affordable PR campaigns. Trusted sources of media usually include print, broadcast and online, together with bloggers and podcasts, all of which can be targeted via informative press releases or other press material digitally.A potential client recently explained to me how she spent over R30,000 on a single advert with little ROI, and I wondered why she’d invest so much in just one portal, whereas a digital PR campaign can possibly offer multiple chances for exposure in the media, at a fraction of the cost. A digital publicity campaign is a budget-friendly form of media exposure for businesses including SMEs.Digital publicity (PR) campaignA digital publicity campaign can compromise of a press release, fact sheet, images, infographics or testimonials, or a combination, sent to all relevant media across a large database including print, online and broadcast. In turn, the client usually gets opportunities for coverage, interviews, commentary, and exposure.One SME client was pleasantly surprised by the coverage opportunities. The client never thought it was possible for a small business to be seen on TV, and featured in newspapers and on radio, with such an affordable campaign. The client thought that only large corporate companies can afford to embark on successful media campaigns.All businesses should try to get a chance to tell their stories or promote their topics and embark on a PR campaign soonThe value of PR could be much more rewarding and long-lasting than that of advert placement. Audiences may be able to relate more to the messaging, while the business itself can reach more media, more cost-effectively. Press releases or digital publicity campaigns can be invaluable in terms of being informative, factual, storytelling (testimonials) and awareness tools. How can a brand or business benefit from PR campaigns?Media targetingCampaigns are customised according to the industry, the objectives, and the audiences. PR agencies often update their extensive media databases daily and create a custom media list for each campaign.Brand building, spokesperson opportunities and media relationship buildingA PR campaign offers an opportunity for key messages to reach audiences and for possible exposure for the brand or key spokespersons. From experience, I've had journalists regularly asking for specific brands or spokespersons to give commentary on related topics or to help with relevant questions, and that’s an example of how a campaign can help with brand building and relationship building in the media”, says Tranica. Budget flexibilityPR campaigns are also budget-flexible on certain elements. PR agencies can disseminate releases drafted by clients, for example, to help ease budget constraints related to copywriting, and coordination fees for digital publicity campaigns are also usually more negotiable compared to booking an advertisement. AwarenessI encourage small businesses to try PR as a form of storytelling and as an awareness tool for their key topic or objective. A press release should include a key angle, stats that are relevant and information that is applicable to their business. Awareness is key in PR and coverage does not always entail a guaranteed product or service promotion by name; therefore, it is crucial to differentiate between advertising and PR, so that client expectations are managed effectively. Audience Inclusion and reachWhile PR campaigns still use and propagate social media, these platforms can also be seen to alienate some age groups or other audiences who cannot access it whereas traditional radio, television and print media are much more accessible. This is why advertising on social media can still exclude some key audiences, not forgetting a budget that must stretch across portals to reach different social media channels. Businesses have to sometimes consider targeting importance for example on social media versus possible higher reach using PR campaigns.  Measurements Coverage reports, reach, ROI and AVE (Advertising Value Equivalent) are usually key indicators to measure a campaign. However, more in-depth information such as sentiment reports can be included. A basic media monitoring system will offer most of these measurements and clips of coverage received. Clients can promote their coverage on their social media pages etc., and they can recycle material by sharing online links of their coverage. It is also recommended that spokespersons undergo basic media training to know how to handle the media depending on the context of the campaign. Drive your messages todayAccording to Nielsen, staying put in our homes can lead to an increase of almost 60% in the amount of content we watch, obviously depending on an individual’s area of interest. So why not use this time to build your brand, create awareness of your topic and build your media presence? Businesses should invest in PR not just because of lockdown but as part of future campaigns too. With the recent spike in fake news over the past few years, consumers are looking to credible media sources for factual information or articles and a PR agency can help get your brand or businesses story on credible media platforms.
