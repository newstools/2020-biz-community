Our network currently reaches an audience of over 1.3 million people with a reach of 21.76% over a four-week period focusing on LSM 7-10,” says Remi Du Preez, commercial director at Tractor.When asked about the collab between the media owners they had the following to say:Richard Wilkinson, MD at Relativ Media, says: “I am very excited about the launch of The United Network. Great things happen when you work with similar minded and proactive partners.  I am sure that this opportunity is going to be a hit in the market and that our clients and agencies will enjoy massive exposure and great value.”“A real game-changer; advertisers are struggling with the fragmentation of the industry and this one of a kind product really simplifies the DOOH landscape. Gauteng is the financial core of Africa and generates 34% of SA’s GDP. The United Network gives advertisers an opportunity to really engage with their consumers in the economic hub of the country. We have taken the best sites from multiple companies and united them into one to create the largest Digital Citilite Network in the country. Collectively we have looked at the challenges that advertisers have and worked together to provide a solution,” says Sean Busschau at Insight Outdoor.“DOOH is a growing medium worldwide and we are extremely excited about expanding our digital footprint in South Africa to deliver dynamic quality packages for our clients and their brands. We are extremely pleased to have partnered with media owners of such great calibre and we now look forward to the positive results,” says Simon Wall, CEO at Tractor. OOH has really made an indent in the media landscape and with the latest technology trend out there OMC Road has now made it possible for media owners to provide comprehensive data along with their campaigns, to show advertisers exactly where their money is best spent. The United Network does precisely that, it simplifies, enabling the buyer to now buy one network of high-quality sites without having to deal with multiple media owners.
