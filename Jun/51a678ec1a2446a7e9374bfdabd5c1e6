Creative thinking, a force for driving positive changeThe Impact categories highlight work that explores some of the most important issues defining our world today and demonstrates how creative thinking can be a force for driving positive change, in the belief that purpose can enhance business success and value, alongside promoting collective responsibility for the global sustainability agenda.Introduced last year, the Side Hustle category reflects the increasing number of creatives applying their skills and personal passions to side projects. From creating new businesses to developing initiatives to address social and environmental issues, this category aims to spotlight world-class creativity beyond people’s day jobs.The Next categories award emerging creatives, designers, directors and illustrators to recognise the next generation of creative talent. The platform seeks to recognise their work and showcase their ideas to creative influencers, mentors and agencies. Today’s Pencil announcement includes 16 out of the total of 34 categories. Further Pencil winners announcements are scheduled for 16 June, 16 July, 8 September and 10 September. A full list of dates can be found below. While hosting a 2020 ceremony is not possible due to coronavirus, D&AD will be announcing this year’s Pencil winners via their website and in a social campaign designed by Studio Dumbar.Custom Instagram Stories augmented reality filterTo celebrate the winners in the absence of a physical awards show, D&AD and Studio Dumbar have created a custom Instagram Stories augmented reality filter that reveals virtual Wood, Graphite, Yellow and White D&AD Pencils to the winners. While they can’t take to the stage this year to accept their Pencils, winners can enjoy a moment of celebration by being virtually awarded through the D&AD Pencil Unboxing filter, accessible through a private link that is being emailed to the winners. Tim Lindsay, D&AD Chairman, commented: Judging by the first round of Pencil winners, it is clear that it has been another outstanding year for global creativity. At a time when the world is in crisis, it feels poignant to begin with a broad spectrum of categories and celebrate the craft, impact and potential our creative community has to offer. It is hugely encouraging to see the progressive and vibrant direction that our industry is heading towards, and D&AD are excited to announce further Pencil winners across the coming weeks.D&AD this year continues to platform the most exceptional work from the past 12 months, following the same rigorous judging process that holds creativity to the highest standards. Famously tough to win, there are no quotas for D&AD Awards, meaning that the number of awarded entries fluctuates each year. In some years, no Black Pencils - the highest creative accolade - are awarded. The highest ever awarded in one year currently stands at seven. Winning work will not only receive an esteemed D&AD Pencil, but it will also be featured in the D&AD Annual and online archive – the definitive guide for creatives all around the world.
