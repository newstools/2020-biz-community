Members of the public are invited to nominate organisations who need masks by visiting Smile 90.4FM’s website, and can also make a donation towards the one million facemasks at the same time. “We have noticed that there is a huge demand for masks, for many people have no access to them. In the coming weeks, Smile 90.4FM in partnership with Brimstone Investment Corporation aim to give away one million cloth facemasks to local organisations and groups of people who desperately need masks. With the power of radio and the incredibly generous and loyal Smile 90.4FM audience, we want to make a difference by changing lives, and protecting lives in this case,” said Smile 90.4FM managing director Lois O’Brien. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/563142.jpg" alt="One Million Masks for Cape Town" width="950" height="436">If you would like to contribute to the Smile-in-Action One Million Masks for Cape Town initiative (at only R16 per mask) visit smile904.fm and pledge your support.
