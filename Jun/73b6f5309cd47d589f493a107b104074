Given the massive following of TikTok, it is an excellent start that parents and learners are being pointed to safety features.” What do you need to know?Make sure you’re the right ageBefore accessing TikTok, an age-gate measure is available at the sign-up stage to ensure only users aged 13 years and older can gain access to the platform. This is also referred to in the Terms of Service. Tips for parents: TikTok has an app store rating of 12+ which means that parents can simply block it from their teen’s phone by using device-based parental controls if they need to.Level up on privacyOnce you have successfully signed up, your TikTok account is set to public automatically, which means anyone can view or comment on your videos. Creator, @Kelly_KiKx, shares a video with her safety tip on how you can limit interactions and decide who can comment, like or message you on TikTok. Users also have the option of setting their account to private which means when someone wants to follow you, you’ll need to approve them as a follower before they can see your content.   @safecommunityafrica How to personalize interactions on TikTok, check it out!@Kelly KiKx ♬ original sound - safecommunityafrica   Remember, you can also “block a user” so they won't be able to interact with you at all.Tips for parents: Parents are advised to work together with their teens to find the best interaction preference to ensure great user experience while on TikTok.Cap your screen timeTikTok's Screen Time Management function can be found in the privacy and settings options under the section "Digital Wellbeing".

This will be a reminder that the time spent online has been used up.Being thoughtful about your profile It’s good to note that even with private settings your profile photo, user name and bio are available to all TikTok users. Sharing personal information like your phone number, or your home or email address can heighten the risk of identity theft, spam, and compromises your general safety. Keep personal information limited. This tutorial illustrates the value of being thoughtful about what you choose to share in your profile and videos.    @tiktoktips Keep your bio sweet and simple, for privacy's sake. �� ♬ original sound - tiktoktips   Tips for parents: Safeguard the amount of personal information shared online by helping teenagers understand why certain information should be kept confidential.Enable Family Pairing for extra support and safetyThis functionality allows parents and teens to customise their safety settings based on individual needs.
