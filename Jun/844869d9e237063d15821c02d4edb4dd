The bacteria are fed with a nutrient that makes them produce a pigment, which can then be used to dye almost any kind of fibre. Streamateria makes fabrics in closed material loops, a circular production chain with zero tolerance to waste. Streamateria materials are constructed of a printed mesh-structure, coated with a bioplastic to create a garment.“Our times require us to rethink not only what to create but also how we create,” said Romain Girard, senior head of innovation at Puma. “With Design to Fade, we are working on a future, which focuses on sustainable production methods and recyclable materials.”
