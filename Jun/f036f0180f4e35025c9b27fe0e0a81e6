She has 10 years’ experience in the advertising industry having graduated with an Honours Degree in Strategic Brand Communications from Vega. Commenting on Masuta’s appointment, Stuart Walsh, chief strategy officer at Grey Advertising Africa notes, “Ever since I met Sindi when she was in account management, but a closet strategist, I’ve tried all manner of enticement to get her to succumb to ‘the dark side’ and join the strategy department. It took six years to turn her but already after just three months, it’s been well worth the wait!”  Masuta is very excited to be joining Grey’s strategy department. “This is an area of advertising that I’ve always been intrigued by, so I’m thrilled that my career has now taken a more decisive turn in this direction. Advertising is an exhilarating industry to be a part of, and the strategy side of the business will allow me to make even more of an impact on my clients’ campaigns,” she says.
