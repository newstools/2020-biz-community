Many creatives told us they could really use the inspiration and positive shared experience of the awards, and that motivated us to push forward with online judging and special streaming winners’ presentations.” He added: “As the industry’s largest program for celebrating creativity this year, The One Show 2020 is the authoritative show for global creative excellence, and global platform for bringing the industry together.”Special AwardsThis year’s special awards winners will be announced tomorrow, 18 June at 12:00 pm EDT (6 pm CAT) on The One Club website and social channels in a special “The One Show For All”-themed streaming video created by hip-hop improv group and Broadway stars Freestyle Love Supreme.

The One Show judges focus on creativity of ideas and quality of execution, while ADC Annual Awards juries maintain their historic concentration as the champion for craft, design and innovation.In early March, The One Club announced the switch from in-person to online judging for both of this year’s awards shows. The change allowed jury members from around the world to continue to review entries in safe environments, and enabled the shows to maintain the global integrity and quality to the judging process. In-person judging, Creative Week and The One Show, ADC Annual Awards and Young Ones Student Awards ceremonies in New York will resume in 2021.
