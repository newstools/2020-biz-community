But as this virus begins to subside and normality seems to be just around the corner, it is important for public organizations and business owners to make sure they create a safe environment for citizens and customers in order to keep the spread of this virus at bay.Thus, a large LED screen is the perfect solution to keep people up to date with the latest safety measures and inform passers-by of the latest official updates. It is a great alternative to handing out flyers or conventional posters, as it helps save up on paper and promotes social distancing. But it is not only public institutions that can benefit from the advantages of these devices. This is also a great option for outdoor advertising. Whether placed on busy streets or by main highways, LED displays will stand out and deliver video and image adverts in high definition even in broad daylight.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/558566.jpg" alt="LED screens: the perfect solution to inform the public safely" width="625" height="313">The same goes for LED screens for shops and shop windows, which can help businesses display all their offers and products from afar when there are restrictions for the number of people allowed in commercial premises.
