Consequently, to drive online sales, Arora Online established an Instagram Shop so that Whimsical Collection’s followers could buy the range straight from their feeds. The shop was optimised to ensure a seamless experience for social customers. Whimsical Collection’s first Instagram story produced a 20% click-through rate, demonstrating the powerful role of social commerce.A problem faced was that, due to Covid-19, Facebook implemented strict guidelines around advertising certain products, including face masks. Arora Online overcame this by employing strategic tactics to increase organic reach and awareness. This strategy resulted in posts reaching almost 12,000 people organically. The Facebook page saw a 72% increase in likes and engagement increased by 23%. Instagram followers grew by over 10% in a few weeks. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/563442.jpg" alt="How a small business pivoted to win on social media during Covid-19" width="950" height="565">The campaign produced an engagement rate of 6% - besting the industry average of 3.22%.
