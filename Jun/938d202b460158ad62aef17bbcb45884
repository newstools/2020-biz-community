The significant month of June, which commemorates the Soweto Uprisings, has seen YFM launch The Put On, aimed at helping young entrepreneurs.  More than just creating this platform to support youth-driven business and entrepreneurship through advertising, YFM is also looking for more youth-owned businesses which can be added to its supplier database.  This 12-week intensive initiative includes calls for entries, digital and listener engagement, top 20 finalist announcements, and a Dragon’s Den-style pitch process. This pitch process will allow entrepreneurs to meet the judging panel – which consists of YFM’s MD, Haseena Cassim; the founder of Legends Barber, Sheldon Tatchell; the founder of The Throne Agency, Caron Williams; the founder of Thirst Busters and Put On 2019 winner, Linaker Phahle; and the founder and CEO of The Bar Group, Legend Manqele – who will act as mentors, challenging these business owners to new heights. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/562214.jpg" alt="Cyril Zuma, from iStock Photography, was a finalist in The Put On 2019 and is currently on YFM’s photography supplier’s list." width="200" height="299">Cyril Zuma, from iStock Photography, was a finalist in The Put On 2019 and is currently on YFM’s photography supplier’s list.The next phase will include the announcement of winners and the creation of ads which will then go live on air.
