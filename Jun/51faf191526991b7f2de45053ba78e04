The digital publication was also the most trusted news brand in South Africa in 2019.   "The website News24 has built credibility on the back of investments in breaking news," the report noted.   News24 editor-in-chief Adriaan Basson said the recognition by the Reuters Institute is probably the most important recognition in the industry.  "Trust is our only and most important currency. I am extremely proud of the News24 team for another excellent year of agenda-setting, truthful journalism," Basson said.  News24, also South Africa's most-read digital publication, has recently launched a redesigned mobile and desktop website to better showcase journalists' original, award-winning journalism.  This follows after the release of a new News24 mobile app in February.  The 2020 Reuters Institute Digital news report found that 90% of South Africans consume their news online.  Of those, 52% consume news on desktop, 82% on a smartphone and 17% on a tablet.
