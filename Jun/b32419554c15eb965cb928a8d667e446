<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/559170.jpg" alt="Workbench's resourcefulness helps Denny to 'add goodness'" width="950" height="514">Proudly local brand Denny Mushrooms wanted to show its solidarity with the restaurant industry and at the same time raise awareness around mushrooms as a delicious and healthy ingredient. Workbench was tasked to come up with a campaign in a very short space of time against the marketing objective. The question was: How do you take a limited budget and timeframe and turn it into an impactful brand campaign that not only does good for the brand but also does good for the brand’s clients and the community at large?Workbench conceptualised the Denny Support your Local initiative, which called out to communities to support their local eatery. Allied to the campaign was communicating to the restaurants to get them to register a crowdfunding account and register on the microsite -www.dennysupportyourlocal.co.za, which is still open for contribution, today. The call to action and the awareness campaign was delivered in terms of encouraging the general public to vote for their favourite eatery and help raise funds. Denny committed to giving the restaurant with the most votes R10,000 and a three-month supply of mushrooms.Michael Cook, MD of Workbench says: “These unprecedented times have made all brands relook their strategies and spend. Gone are the days of bulky agencies who theorise more than make things happen. Creativity has always been about being resourceful with what you have, letting constraint push you further and faster.”Topline results: Four weeks123 restaurants registered on microsite www.dennysupportyourlocal.co.za 37,700 visits to microsite and 12,711 total votesROI on awareness: 1:10Martin Sing, head of planning at Workbench, went on to say: “Together, with creative partners - Twiga Communications, No Menu media specialists, The Squad and 1cstm – the campaign was synchronised in such a way that it achieved way more than expected, and added to CSI projects already implemented by Denny Mushrooms. The beauty of the initiative is that it lives on beyond the campaign timeframe. It will continue to provide awareness and an avenue for communities to support their local, which is great.”Samantha McChesney, Denny Mushrooms marketing director, says: “It was important that the Denny brand stood up and was counted in the crisis. Even though our business was under pressure the Workbench guys found a way to achieve our brand objectives as well as provide a platform that tastefully and genuinely helped restaurants. The feedback has been wonderful.”About Workbench: Workbench is a full service, through-the-line marketing communications agency based in Johannesburg with clients in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban as well as the UK and Philippines.
