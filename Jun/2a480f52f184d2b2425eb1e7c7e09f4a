They take existing assets like residential walls and spaza shops in townships and convert them into wifi-enabled advertising canvases, which in turn benefits township communities. Local communities benefit financially from the advertising revenue and the introduction of free wifi into their neighbourhoods. This offers advertisers a unique opportunity to increase brand presence at key convergence points, and drive positive brand salience by giving back to their consumers, the township community. This echoes Mamela's philosophy of creating a sustainable ecosystem of shared value to drive growth in the mass market and foster lasting bonds with brands. In Leigh's view "when brands deliver true value to their consumers, they incubate the household brand name."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/559871.gif" alt="Mamela Media partners with fellow township experts, Keys Communications" width="625" height="470">By implementing a cross-media strategy using a mix of media, Mamela keep brands connected and top of mind throughout their consumers' daily journey.
