The exhibition of work by up-and-coming creatives is always a must-see feature of the Festival. If you missed this showcase at the Artscape Theatre Centre in February, you can 'meet' the entire class of 2020 via the Design Indaba website. One of this year's talents is Morena Moletsane, a Gauteng-based illustrator who pairs technical prowess with a passion for African short stories. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/562321-625x325.png" alt="Morena Moletsane, a Gauteng-based illustrator." width="625" height="325">Morena Moletsane, a Gauteng-based illustrator.Moletsane talks to us about the significance of youth month and why he believes the pandemic has levelled the playing field for all industries..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about yourself and your background.My grandfather was the art initiator in the family and most of our family art interests started from there. My siblings are gifted in communications, TV presenting, radio and writing respectively. I had grappled with finding the fitting career path as I was a lot more visual. Spending time with my late grandfather as a child and being part of a family of communicators made it fitting for me to pursue an education in graphic design majoring in multimedia design. With my design background, I'm diving deeper into finding ways of communicating visuals, through illustration and animation, trying to communicate African concepts with a more digital medium. My current work sees me being part of a digital marketing agency where I work on and maintain brand identity and come up with innovative visuals. My passion is also in apparel and street culture, that inspired me to initiate an upcoming brand @borotho_za to better explore African concepts and ideas.    View this post on InstagramWe kick start this journey with excitement! looking to tell stories and explore ideas that will add value, Let’s break bread Ekse!! #artcollective #branddesigner #urbanfashion #urbanstyle #streetwear #instaart #brandstorytelling #branding #visualcontent #styleblogger #illustration #borothoA post shared by  Borotho (@borotho_za) on Apr 6, 2019 at 4:28am PDT.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are some of the highlights in your career so far?Working on the South African movie, Catching Feelings, which premiered at the LA Film Festival in 2018 and is a Netflix original movie (I was part of creating the intro sequence that was a narration by the lead character).Having worked on an e.tv show called Next of Next Week Season 3.

The street apparel is what I am dreaming about at the moment. I see great possibility for this brand to find its roots in South African fashion and street culture. Working in film is also a great passion as I am a film enthusiast. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you think the industry can improve on and how can young creatives help bring this change about?The industry can improve by allowing for more upcoming creatives and artists to get involved with these bigger brands. Nowadays to get a commission with a big organisation requires one to have great PR or relationship. A great example would be Karabo Poppy. Her work has been outstanding. She has led the industry from an illustrative and design point of view. However, it would be great for the market to open up a bit more. My call is for brands to be less conservative. It would be great to see an array of talents popping up throughout the course of a year. It has been happening but I believe there's an untapped skill in South Africa.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1604/337994-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Karabo Poppy Moletsane" width="120" height="120">Karabo Moletsane and Cotton On team up to take designs globalSouth Africa has recently seen a massive rejuvenation of young, talented illustrators who are changing their industry with fresh designs. This is fast becoming the new trend on social media...13 Apr 2016.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}The Covid-19 crisis is likely to have a significant impact on the opportunities available for professional development for young South Africans. Do you have any words of encouragement?More than anything I believe the pandemic has levelled the playing field for industries. Going into lockdown created a time for people to be innovative. I believe the key to conquering is in being able to master yourself. That's what lockdown has taught me – to be disciplined in the comfort of my home. Many times we think the only way to being productive people or being successful in making an income is by working at an office and being monitored.The lockdown and Covid-19 made me realise that it is possible to craft your own brand at your personal desk. Investing in the internet can be a launchpad to where you want to go. Just get with the times, especially with all things concerning digital. I also believe that with the internet, South Africa isn't our only market. I realised this working with a couple of concept artists at Diprente Films. One of them being @tako_universe. He established some clients from America and had several requests from people who sought some of his skills.    View this post on InstagramMiss Universe! ✨✨✨Black Girl Fly @zozitunzi #missuniverse2019 @missuniverse #missuniverse #blackgirlfly #xhosa #takouniverseA post shared by  Terence Ntsako Tako Maluleke (@tako_universe) on Dec 10, 2019 at 8:30am PST.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What to you is the significance of Youth Month in 2020?This serves as a reminder to the privileges we have today as young South Africans. It's a reminder that my time should be used effectively as a youth. That I'm living with certain privileges that my parents didn't experience because I need to serve a greater purpose with my skills and efforts. Other than that, youth month is also a reminder that I need to challenge the norms in South Africa and cherish the fact that I don't have any wrinkles on my face at the moment..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Words you live by?Everything is God-given.
