This vision has been inspired by Eastern and Western aesthetics with a modern twist. Therefore, as part of the brand’s visual identity, most pieces will bear a kintsugi mark, a tribute to the Japanese savoir-faire.Within this collection, Takada has fashioned three underlying themes: Sakura, Maiko and Shogun. The Japanese designer weaves together the organic and geometric forms and patterns.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/535424.jpg" alt="Kenzo Takada unveils new luxury home and lifestyle brand" width="600" height="361">Inspired by nature, the Sakura theme creates an overall feeling of harmony and tranquillity with intricate floral motifs. The oneiric theme boasts hints of gold with a subtle pastel palette of pink and yellow.With vibrant reds and pinks, illuminated with touches of gold, Maiko blends geometric lines and organic shapes. This theme echoes the delicate and refined spirit of the Maikos; these young Geishas in the making are renowned for their kimonos, and their delicate red and white makeup.Shogun powerfully evokes solemnity, with dramatic black and ivory monochromes. This graphic and geometric theme brings a sharp flair to interiors, whilst encapsulating modernity and sophisticated elegance.Featuring a myriad of vivid colours and bold patterns, Takada’s designs are reflective of his joyful creative universe.
