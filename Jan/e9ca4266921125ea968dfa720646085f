When all is thrown into the pot, I hope that what survives is the human.  I believe that we’re in the era of “The death of agency”. This is about many things: The death of the old-format agency and the birth of a new kind of agency that marketers want – a lean, agile, collaborative little shop, in-house talent and super digital smarts, big data and insights, brand-dedicated creatives and smart package-able work that travels across markets. But I’m also talking about the death of agency, sans the definite article. I’m referring to the loss of independent thinking and the extinction of that special and powerful thing creatives have – freedom of will, instinct and gut, sensibility and that intangible ability to translate simple human insights into unique storytelling.Now we have a problem of growing distrust in ad agencies and an eroded credibility. Client and agency sleep with their backs to each other and there’s a gaping hole in the middle of the bed. The agency model has to break and be born again, but change does not belong solely on the laps of advertisers. Marketers and CMOs need to be more accountable in this journey.The trend of fear and suspicion must be uprooted on both sides and for the brave and curious future we need the following:No more lack of conscienceI loathe the brands that pretend to have a concrete interest in social investment when behind closed doors, self-serving purposes are revealed. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/486988-120x120.jpg?2" alt="YPO member James Barty - also ACA chairperson and CEO of King James Group." width="120" height="120">#YPOEdge: James Barty on brand humanity and doing good business, beyond ticking the 'CSI box'Leigh Andrews speaks to King James founder and YPO member James Barty about what he gains from his involvement in YPO and how all businesses can make a better impact...By Leigh Andrews 14 Mar 2019People are demanding more of brands. Those brands that behave in more human ways thrive and those that remain on the cold outskirts of good intent will fade away. It’s brave to stand for something and to do that, a brand has to know itself intimately. The job of the agency is not to stand by and comply but to help a brand find its core values. Like Australian adman and founder of Droga5 David Droga said: “Interrogate a brand until it confesses what it is.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/485244-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Design Indaba CEO and founder Ravi Naidoo with David Droga, founder and creative chairman, Droga5. © ." width="120" height="120">#DesignIndaba2019: Droga: Make advertising that people give a shit aboutThree days of Design Indaba inspiration culminated in headline act David Droga, whose career in advertising traverses Saatchi & Saatchi in London, Publicis, NYC, to starting his own New York-based agency, Droga5 in 2006...By Terry Levin 4 Mar 2019No more ignoranceAgencies need to speak ‘business’ and marketers need to speak ‘creative’. The marketer who only knows how to dish out briefs and tick boxes is the most inadequate marketer. And the creative who only cares about the pretty pictures is outdated and shortsighted. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/526965-120x120.png?2" alt="Machine_'s Sarah Browning-de Villiers and Sanlam's Francois Uys." width="120" height="120">6 reasons why client-agency relationships failIn conversation with Sanlam Reality's head of marketing, communications and digital, Francois Uys, Machine's chief content officer Sarah Browning-de Villiers writes about what makes agency-client relationships succeed or fail...By Sarah Browning-de Villiers 18 Nov 2019We have to stand in each other’s shoes and discard comfort. True collaboration means both parties levelling up on knowledge and truly co-parenting the brand.No more key visualsIf I have to be asked to do one more key visual for a campaign, I might spontaneously combust and have my ashes sent to the Ganges river. There is nothing more limiting and tick-boxy than a key visual. Stop asking for them. They’re a silly crutch used by marketers to show their global counterparts that they’re falling in line. In client feedback, I have seen entire decks of creative executions completely ignored in favour of this question:Where’s the key visual?In all seriousness, campaigns these days are so different and complex, yet we’re still relying on a one-dimensional, archaic way of summarising creative thinking. We need a new campaign-idea cheat sheet. Let’s step into a more advanced future, where we’re prototyping, inventing or experimenting instead of staring at an A4 layout.More human diversityIf you want an interesting solve to a problem, have more interesting people in the room.

Be brave about the minds you choose for the work you want to make. Be curious about the people missing in your organisation. Think about gender, race, sexual orientation, culture, age and language. Diversity is not about quotas, it’s about representation and inclusivity. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/514226-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Understand true diversity to become more inclusively creative" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Understand true diversity to become more inclusively creativeOne of the most interesting sessions of the DStv Seminar of Creativity at #Loeries2019 creative week touched on the difference between inherent and acquired diversity.

More planning, more decisiveness, more realistic deadlines. The entire industry needs an overhaul of its working conditions. It’s long been a sweat shop and we’re all too afraid to change it.I’m curious about a future where wellness is truly honoured, where humanity is just part of business and where we behave more like humans in order to talk to the ones we call consumers. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511926-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Is 40 hours a week enough?

And 500 years is a bloody long time. But we gave it a go. And then we went to an unplanned lunch.

To reach the heart of another human, we don’t need another algorithm.It’s the year 2020 - the year that sci-fi movies once referenced as the ‘future’. And we’re all staring into the unknown. My hope for this industry is that we can leap into this unknown, in true Eddie Izzard style.
