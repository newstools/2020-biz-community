Data fuels our technologies, economies, populations, politics, education, healthcare, future work, and in reality, it fuels our overall survival.Data is the new oilEvery 60 seconds 4,166,667 Facebook users like a post, 300 hours of new video is uploaded to YouTube, Apple users download 51,000 apps. And this will continue to grow at a rapid pace. In 2020 smartwatches will produce 28 PetaBytes per minute, that is 4 times what Facebook produced in 2019. With every swipe, every like, every snap, and every view that you create gives us data to better profile the users we target online. <img src="https://biz-file.com/b/1604/571969.jpg?1" alt="Sadek Jake Alam" width="120" height="120">Big data and content marketing: A match made in heavenAccording to an eMarketer report, total digital ad spending in the US will surpass total TV ad spending in 2017...By Sadek Jake Alam 19 Apr 2016The internet has produced a ton of juicy data for us, but this data is only valuable once it’s been refined and the more it is connected, the more it increases in value.

That also has meant that the value and economic potential of that data has increased exponentially.One way to imagine data is seeing it as an asset class – just like oil and other commodities. In 2017, The Economist wrote that data is the new oil. Customers have become aware of how valuable their data has become and have grown increasingly weary of their exposure over the internet. The stringent regulations introduced by acts like Protection of Personal Information (PoPIA) and the European version, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provide a level of protection for customers and complexity for organisations. There is however still value in anonymised information.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/408278-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Allan Swart ©" width="120" height="120">#Pamro2017: Data is becoming the oil of consumer marketingLeana Less, vice president of global connections and media at Coca-Cola, explores the benefits of agile marketing if done correctly at this year's Pamro conference...By Juanita Pienaar 29 Aug 2017Data should trigger innovationWe must shift how we view and treat data in order to better prepare for an increasingly data-saturated future.
