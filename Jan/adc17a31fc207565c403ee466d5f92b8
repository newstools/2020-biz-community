Do they assist our decision-making or are they a badge that we wear to help us feel like we're in the know?By Jacques du Bruyn 8 Mar 2019And lest we forget that chasm that exists between fads and evergreen truths.  A decade ago, trends for 2010 included social media, growth of video, AR and VR, integrated communications, transparency, trust, less interruption, more engagement. The list goes on. Today, many still refer to these as trends.  Ten years ago, thought leaders were discussing gender imbalance across the board, mental health issues in the creative industries, sexualised depiction of women in campaigns, addressing talent issues and on and on it went. And? Has this changed?So, let’s rather look at three key realities in the South African context that will either continue haunting us, help direct us, further endear us with clients, or possibly just be refreshed stepping stones on the path to continually formulating and delivering incredible strategic and creative work for the brands that entrust us with their assets...Societal: GBV and xenophobiaThese are societal issues, or rather societal ills that affect every single one of us. They affect our relationships, our perceptions, our mental state and, to an extent, our day-to-day lives. As a nation and as a profession, it is imperative that we play our part in altering the daily discourse around the why, the where and the when. We need to change our actions, from slacktivism to something more effective. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1707/402902-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ioulia Bolchakova © –" width="120" height="120">#CSIMonth: Going beyond armchair activismThere's been a rise in criticism for only performing acts of good on Mandela Day, but there's a similar trend of eye-rolling at the clicktivism of keyboard warriors or ‘slacktivists'...By Leigh Andrews 24 Jul 2017These are real issues we face on a daily basis, and as an industry, as professionals working within it, we need to be the spark that sets the motor of a new set of actions in motion.We are quick to lay claim to our ability to create and sway public opinion. We claim to be able to drive public temperament, create and entrench societal norms.  It is our collective effort that results in luxuries becoming necessities, creating demand where there was none, all the while boosting consumerism.The question we should be asking ourselves, or rather addressing, is, ‘What are we doing about gender-based violence (and by extension gender inequality) and xenophobia?’<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/529089.jpg" alt="#FairnessFirst: Taking action beyond #16DaysofActivism" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Taking action beyond #16DaysofActivismUnfortunately, gender-based violence is a harsh reality of everyday life for the majority of South African women.

How do we play our part in altering the course of gender inequality and its ills, while building a truly united South Africa?Industry-specific financial realities: MarginsMargins have always been a talking point for any business, not just within advertising. Many agencies are facing shrinking margins and extended payment terms, a result possibly of the global financial environment, which as we all know, has seen better days. Much better! <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/485715-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Minister of finance, Tito Mboweni delivering his budget speech for 2019. © ." width="120" height="120">#Budget2019: The aloe in the roomMathe Okaba, CEO of the ACA, looks at the 2019 Budget and what the communication and advertising sector can learn from it...By Mathe Okaba 5 Mar 2019As long as advertising is seen as a cost centre for brands, clients extend payment terms, ‘in-house’ work that should be the domain of our profession continues and the ACA Code of Conduct is flouted, margins will continue to come under pressure. We cannot combat all the changes and developments, but those that we can counter should be done in a coordinated fashion – with one industry voice. There is strength in numbers. Validating our existence and value addition: Marketing effectivenessThere can be no greater weapon in an industry’s arsenal than that of proving its reason for being.We exist not only to create pretty pictures, emotive stories and powerful pay off lines, but more so, to provide communications solutions to a business objective or problem. This is our currency.Our ability to deliver campaigns that shift the needle for brands and deliver effective return on investment should be the number one objective in any agency. It is immaterial whether we use the latest social media platform, activation, radio or word of mouth, or employ programmatic and Blockchain, or the latest bubbling-under method to engage consumers to do this. The key ultimately, is the output, not the method.2020 will see the first Effie Awards South Africa programme take place. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/530799-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Effie Awards South Africa launched by ACA" width="120" height="120">Effie Awards South Africa launched by ACAThe Association for Communication and Advertising has launched the 2020 Effie Awards South Africa...9 Dec 2019There will be no better time to prove the value of the work that agencies create. This global marketing effectiveness awards programme honours the one truly significant achievement in advertising and marketing communications – results. It places South African work in the company of the most effective campaigns worldwide and reflects on the competency of our industry.What it really does, if it should be reduced to its most basic explanation, is that it proves to clients that we are partners and not merely service providers. So, 2020 will be what we make it, not what it does for us. It’s time that we strategise to solve our own industry problems, build brand ‘adland’ to our own benefit, and give back and drive consumer perception, as a consolidated voice around societal issues which affect all of us.
