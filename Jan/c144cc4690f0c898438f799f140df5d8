In the USA, Spencer Stuart reports that the CMO tenure has also shrunk to an average 43 months. <img src="https://biz-file.com/b/1709/63315.jpg?3" alt="Chris Moerdyk" width="120" height="120">Why do big brands keep making the same mistakesToo many marketers as well as brand and advertising managers still aren't thinking things through and these mistakes are costing a fortune...By Chris Moerdyk, Issued by Chris Moerdyk 30 Sep 2015SA may not have a consolidated study in this regard, however a track of marketing appointments reflects the same 'revolving doors' trend. This is not only important to know but also worrisome for several reasons, some of which I expand upon below. 1. The disconnectIf there is a disconnect between what ‘business leadership’ expects and what ‘marketing delivers’, then a strain in the relationship can be expected. Where there is no acceptance that ‘the business is the brand and that the brand is the business’, it is easy to make superficial separations of roles about what business focusses on - and have the brand-build agenda tossed over to marketing. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/480274-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BizTrends2019: Speaking of things yet to come" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: Speaking of things yet to comeWhilst it is exciting to think of the future and to guess what may or may not come to pass, it is also an undertaking that requires deep reflection...By Sizakele Marutlulle 31 Jan 2019As we know, brand building is a discipline with cross-divisional undertaking - until CEOs accept their own role in building the brand, and CMOs articulate more clearly the value they add to the ‘bottom line’, this dance and contestation will continue. Organisations will increasingly awake to the reality that marketing is not about ‘bells and whistles’, but truly the engine that if given room to rev to its full potential, can deliver distinctiveness and a sustainable competitive advantage. 2. The destabilisationWhen a CMO leaves a role, it not only destabilises internal functioning but also affects external relations - specifically relations with partner creative and communication agencies. If one departs in the ‘middle’ of a campaign development - often the incumbent will let this run its course as the proverbial ‘horse would have bolted’. However, if the departure happens at the planning stages of new work/campaigns, this could derail the process – as the incumbent may elect to bring into the fold his/her network of creative partners from times past.As a result, there could be emerging tensions between the ‘old’ crowd and ‘new’ – as well as some destabilisation of relations with the marketing practitioners that the CMO would inherit.3. The pitch treadmillNew CMO often means an account is put out to pitch, an unfolding which occurs within the fractured nature of pitch-process handling in SA. Some pitch consultants charge agencies membership fees and then proceed to ‘flood’ them with ‘any’ and ‘all’ RFPs, without undertaking the first-step rigour of segmenting opportunities to match agency type and client culture/need. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525298-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Agence Olloweb on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Agency selection - is there another way?It's time to consider alternatives to this time-consuming and costly practice, writes Angelika Kempe, executive consultant at AdOps...By Angelika Kempe 8 Nov 2019Secondly, the pitch process can take anything between 8-20 weeks, during which time brand-building work is often stalled. Where ‘old work’ is allowed to run as the ‘new work’ is introduced, there is a great probability of a mismatch in language and brand promise. 4. Intersectional brand-buildingThe CMO is not just a cost centre, but the ‘keeper of the flame’. With the evolving focus of the CMO from brand to customer, to culture - it is clear that this role is now an intersectional one. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/447889-120x120.png?2" alt="Image supplied." width="120" height="120">Brand Commune 2018 uncovers whether business purpose is measurableThe annual Brand Commune took place on 19 June 2018 in Johannesburg presented by the Brand Council South Africa (BCSA) to uncover the potential point to purpose for South African brands...5 Jul 2018The emerging requirements are for a person who has multi-cultural competence, is a proponent of problem-based learning, is a collaborator, prioritises experience architecture.Most importantly, the future-fit CMO solves for brand in ways that not only solve the problem creatively, but also advances commercial opportunity alongside a positive impact on culture. The brand is more than the messaging, increasingly the experience trumps the promise and must not just be positive but aligned to the brand’s stated purpose.Any deviation and contradiction will be punished by today’s consumer, who is more than ever “increasingly powerful and feels disdain for brands”. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/531619-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty Images." width="120" height="120">2020: Building the emotive link between customers and our brandsThe ability to build an emotional connection between a brand, an entertainment property, a service, and its consumers, is becoming very much more difficult...By Alan Radmall 12 Dec 2019The today consumer demands that brands be authentic, be real and be human.
