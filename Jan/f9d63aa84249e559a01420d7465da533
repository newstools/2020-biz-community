In fact, Africa has one of the fastest regional growth rates for luxury goods, second only to the Middle East – and by 2020, consumer spending is projected to exceed $1 trillion annually, according to McKinsey’s Global Institute. With an optimistic outlook and growing appetite for luxury goods, the continent offers a promising market for luxury retail well into the future. While a one-size-fits-all approach won’t work for Africa, 2020 will present a number of key trends that will continue to shape the sector, including: ConnectivityOne of the biggest demands on retail in Africa is the need for connectivity – and the luxury retail sector is no exception. Increased internet penetration across the continent is paving the way for e-commerce growth and is a necessity to meet the demands of a younger customer where convenience is king. At Montblanc, we’ve already established e-commerce platforms serving seven countries in Africa – our mission is to be as close to our customers as possible through every touchpoint. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/533945.jpg" alt="Credit: Montblanc" width="600" height="480">Credit: MontblancDigitally-driven campaignsAfrica has an immediate window to international trends, so there is an increased familiarity with brands, driving demand and aspiration for luxury products and lifestyles. The way luxury brands communicate with customers is – and will continue to be – driven by digital, with storytelling, in particular, being key to reach a younger customer base. Digital is a powerful way to increase brand equity and to drive purchase, with online luxury sales expected to triple by 2025, according to McKinsey. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497537-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#AfricaMonth: Alain Dos Santos on growing Montblanc's luxury legacy in Africa" width="120" height="120">#AfricaMonth: Alain Dos Santos on growing Montblanc's luxury legacy in AfricaWhile a growing number of international brands are waking up to the promise of Africa as a valuable market for luxury goods, Montblanc has been growing its presence on the continent for 30 years...By Lauren Hartzenberg 20 May 2019Experience and personalisationToday’s connected and conscious consumer will continue to be presented with innovative ways to capture their attention. Customers are no longer simply purchasing products, but are purchasing experiences and emotions. Virtual and physical experiences will be at the forefront, such as creatively driven pop-up stores and curated in-store environments that reflect the brand’s values and ethos. Another trend that continues to gain momentum across all categories of luxury is personalisation. Providing an opportunity for customers to own a product that is individualised for them – whether in embossed initials on a wallet, or a specific design on their carry-on luggage created by a graffiti artist – is of enormous appeal. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498975-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#AfricaMonth: The rise of Afrocentrism and its impact on the luxury business" width="120" height="120">#AfricaMonth: The rise of Afrocentrism and its impact on the luxury businessAfrica has been a rich source of artistic inspiration for many parts of the world for centuries, but what's changing now is that Afrocentric culture is being spearheaded by the sons and daughters of the African continent...By Lauren Hartzenberg 29 May 2019TechnologyTechnology is an integral part of our daily lives and is becoming a core component of luxury.
