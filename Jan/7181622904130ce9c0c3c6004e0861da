We will miss her presence on our iconic Sunday night lineup, but wish her all the best in her future endeavours.” “Devi is a brave heart in a petite package with the unique ability to make complete sense of complicated issues of an investigative nature, whether these be financial, consumer or legislative,” added Carte Blanche executive producer Wynand Grobler. “We have the utmost respect for the way she carried out Carte Blanche’s principle of ‘truth brings change’ and never backed down to get difficult questions answered. Devi’s legacy will remain.”“When my daughter finished matric last year and received a golf scholarship to the US, I instinctively knew, that it was time to tick off more items on my bucket list,” Govender told M-Net. “It was an incredibly difficult decision to move on, but I will always remember what Trevor Noah told me during our interview in New York: ‘Once you think you are at the top, then you should be finding the place where you are at the bottom.’ I look forward to the future but will never forget my past."After 18 amazing years @Devi_HQ will make her final @CarteBlancheTV appearance on Sunday 26 Jan, on @MNet!— M-Net Corporate (@MnetCorporate) January 16, 2020The #CarteBlanche team wishes @Devi_hq all the best in her future endeavours. We can't thank you enough for the years of dedication and hard work. Your commitment to “Truth brings Change” is heartfelt! https://t.co/DpjLdIVQHC— Carte Blanche (@carteblanchetv) January 16, 2020
