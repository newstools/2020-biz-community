Where do you live, work and play? I live in Pinelands, Cape Town and the Digicape head office is also in Pinelands – how lucky am I! But I also regularly work out of my Cape Town or Stellenbosch stores, and visit my Johannesburg office regularly. Where do I play? That’s a tough question, as I’m blessed to live in Cape Town, but if I’m being totally honest, I’d have to say my home. I’m a regular homebody.2. What’s your claim to fame? Professionally, I’d say delivering great customer experiences.Personally, it’s my butter chicken or pavlova that wins over my family and friends.3. Describe your career so far. A rollercoaster of change. Working in tech is an ever-changing, ever-evolving environment.

I started at the proverbial bottom, in an entry-level position and studied computer graphics after hours to expand my knowledge in the field. I was also lucky enough to receive on-the-job coaching and mentorship, eventually working my way up to the role of training manager of Hirt & Carter’s in-house training school, where I was responsible for compiling the course material and overseeing a large team of trainers. I still laugh about the fact that I’m now in sales – it’s serendipity in a sense, as I was exposed to the all-important sales function during my time in training, and fell in love with the fast-paced nature of this new challenge. I swiftly worked my way through the ranks to sales manager, eventually becoming sales director of Hirt & Carter Graphic.Several years later, the business started a technical division called ‘Hirt & Carter Graphic’, which specialised in Apple technology and software, and I realised this was the opportunity I’d been waiting for. I started my own venture together with a couple of former colleagues, and Digicape was eventually born.
