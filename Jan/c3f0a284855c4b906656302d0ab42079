But what are the biggest trends that will affect OOH advertising within the airport environment on the African continent?It is an exciting time for Africa. Africa is seen as one of the fastest growing economic regions in the world and holds numerous opportunities for brands. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects Africa to be the fastest growing region to 2036 at 5.9% per annum, for a total market of 400 million passengers annually. This will spur a massive growth in out-of-home and digital out-of-home in the airport environment. Increase in passenger numbers a plus for advertisers The first major trend that will directly affect advertising and ROI is increase in passenger numbers and frequency of travel. While South Africa’s GDP – a key driver of traffic volume growth – has languished around 1% per annum, Airports Company South Africa’s Annual Report for 2019 shows that there has been a growth of 1.3% in departure numbers, up to 21,118,264 (FY2017/18: 20,836,852). International arrivals have increased by 0.8%. Also, Cape Town International Airport grew its international traffic by 7.7% and 1.8% domestically. This means that more people are passing through South Africa’s airports, providing brands with a bigger audience to influence. Expansion in airport infrastructure will boost passenger numbers and opportunities to engage Expansion in airport infrastructure is another key trend that will directly affect advertising. Worldwide the areas around airports are becoming designated aerotropolises and airports on the continent are set to follow suit. The trend is for airports to scale towards better air travel and a better experience for travellers. Furthermore, advertising has become integral to airport revenue and as such media installations and products are strategically located to enhance, rather than detract from, the experience. For airports, this ensures that brands keep using the environment to meet their marketing and sales objectives.  For passengers, brand experiences enhance the luxury aspect of travel and affiliation with that brand culture. For advertisers it ensures that millions of consumers within a specific income bracket engage with their messaging in an environment that is captive and conducive to assimilation and purchase influence. It’s a win-win situation for all stakeholders.DOOH in the airport environment elevates campaigns Over the past few years, digital has been a significant game-changer in OOH.
