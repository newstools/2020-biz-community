The last decade came with many other positive dynamics, of course depending on how was approached from different fronts. One significant change that was prominent was the intensiveness of technology infiltrating many industries. One of those that felt the brat of digital technology transformation was the media – most apparent the print media. The emergence of digital technologyThe emergence of digital technology has changed many facets of news reporting and consumption thereof. The newsrooms had to transform though others are struggling because of the lack of funds. Radio still thriving even though podcasting has become a threat. But this a discussion on its own since people believe radio will exist for the next two or three decades to come. The podcast is another platform that thrives because of the convenience made possible by access to the internet – digital technology. Though some radio stations or media houses have managed to transform and as well have their own podcast platform, it still doesn’t mean that radio isn’t walking on a tight rope. For it to certainly exist for the next two to three decades, open-minded management will have to become an integral and critical part of the transformation processes. Thereupon, for radio to perish, it will be out of the willingness of the owners and management – perish at your own ignorance and denial. Above mentioned print or press whichever label one calls it, have virtually experienced the negative impact of digital transformation. However, whether this transformation was negative or positive it was heavily reliant on how media owners approached the process of transformation.

More often than not; a focus on sustainability from a business point of view requires a change in operation and how its leaders think about almost everything. This requires one to let go of the old, and adopt the new...By Bogosi Motshegwa 6 Jan 2020When Ndalo Media closed shop citing a shrinking of profit for print media. Ndalo Media was the owner and publisher of the prestige Destiny and Destiny Man Magazine. When the Bar Leader announces late-year it came as a shocker to many especially those who have been following the story of Destiny Magazine that they’re resurrecting both Destiny and Destiny Man. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/474581-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image via Ndalo Media on ." width="120" height="120">Ndalo Media no more, come 2019NEWSWATCH: News has broken that Khanyi Dhlomo's Ndalo Media will shut its doors for good on 31 January 2019, with its web presence lingering until March 2019.13 Dec 2018It was shocking because when Ndalo Media decided close shop, the decision was heavily influenced by issues regarding the insufficiency of profit because advertisers and as well as consumers no longer buy hardcopy magazines. They consumer content online. So when Bar Leader bought it, it was indeed perplexing, like how are they going to sustain it when the market has become less viable for print magazines.
