We have absolutely no reason to keep smiling. South African women are dying every day and most people are doing nothing about it.As a woman – and the MD of one of the most influential media brands in KwaZulu-Natal, I feel that it is imperative to ensure that the female voice is prominent and heard.Radio is a great place to have discussions, create awareness, and share impactful stories that can instantly impact thousands of people.The relationship between radio and its listeners is based on mutual faith, trust, and friendship. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/474455-120x120.jpg?3" alt="Boni Mchunu, GM of East Coast Radio." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: Integrating digital with traditional mediaAs the new media landscape continues to expand, there is a growing need to find innovative ways of marrying the 'old' with the 'new'...By Boni Mchunu 8 Jan 2019This friendship is why we need to bring the female voice to the forefront of radio in 2020.Females to the forefrontRadio is a part of every social group. In KwaZulu-Natal, East Coast Radio (ECR) is regarded as the fabric that binds KZN together. ECR plays a key role in socialising, informing, and connecting people to find what makes them happy, especially during the hard times.Radio is central to the community it serves. Radio can be used to change the lives of marginalised communities, like women. In South Africa, radio gives a voice and courage to fight the rights of the marginalised people. I personally find radio as a powerful platform to create awareness about various issues, such as politics, health, violence, and climate change.Therefore, government and businesses in South Africa and in other economies, continue to utilise radio to disseminate information. As a South African, I find radio today still very relevant and it continues to be even alongside the growth of digital. During 2019’s ‘16 Days of Activism’, ECR Newswatch interviewed Durban-based abuse survivor Rohini Bisaal about the years of emotional and mental abuse she suffered at the hands of her on-and-off boyfriend. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/787268">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>Her story was well received and touched many listeners. “Rohini Bisaal, this takes courage especially in the Indian community as woman are scared to tarnish their so-called reputation and suffer at the hands of supposed loved ones, so well done and proud that you have gone public, women power is what you symbolise,” one woman wrote on Facebook. Radio’s role in women’s movementsRadio plays such an important role for women’s movements to communicate any issues affecting them, such as women’s rights and gender equality, and to initiate positive, open dialogues where women can express themselves freely.For many countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, radio is helping to tackle issues such as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), other forms of violence against women, and promoting women’s political participation and leadership. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/530886.jpg" alt="Rural areas can and must be connected in Africa" width="120" height="120">Rural areas can and must be connected in AfricaThe potential of Information and Communication Technologies can enhance rural communities opportunities in Africa...By Nora Wahby 10 Dec 2019Thanks to the commitment of grassroots women’s groups, word is spreading through urban and rural areas so that women know their rights and can claim their rights accordingly. In South Africa, we have seen women like Thuli Madonsela, Basetsane Kumalo, and Khanyi Dhlomo influencing the media landscape positively. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511619.jpg" alt="Thuli Madonsela team summits Kili in aid of dignity for women" width="120" height="120">Thuli Madonsela team summits Kili in aid of dignity for womenTwo senior representatives of legal technology company, LexisNexis South Africa, summited Mount Kilimanjaro on Women's Day alongside Professor Thuli Madonsela, after a gruelling five-day journey to the top of Africa's highest peak...Issued by LexisNexis 14 Aug 2019Stories about GBV and femicide in the media paint a sad picture about the safety of women in South Africa, but I am hopeful and excited about the future of radio, especially where female voices are concerned. That will only help fight the scourge of gender-based violence and femicide in the country. In the words of the Duchess of Sussex, we stand together in this moment.
