The jury, chaired by Scott Marsden, SVP, head of marketing, Parachute, also awarded three Special Awards for particular areas of expertise: the Personalisation Award, for the best example of a campaign that used data to segment effectively; the Attribution Award, for the best example of a channel attribution model; and the Data-Driven Insight Award, for a campaign where data helped to identify the right audience at scale.The Grand Prix, as well as the Personalisation Award, has been awarded to Starcom and MRY in the US for the 'Not Just One Creator' campaign for footwear and clothing brand Vans.Capitalising on the increased customisability of its shoes, Vans used influencers to successfully broaden its appeal among teens and young adults in the US, generating both brand awareness and revenue.Commenting on the Grand Prix winning campaign, jury member Benoit Weisser, chief strategy officer, Ogilvy Asia, commented: "Vans went niche but also maximised a commercial audience, and data played a central role in unlocking that."The full winners list of the 2019 Warc Media Awards - Best Use of Data category is:Grand PrixNot Just One Creator · Vans · VF Corporation · Starcom, MRY · United States + Personalisation AwardGoldNext% - Speed is your currency · Nike · Mindshare China · China + Data-Driven Insight AwardDigital Window Shopping · Sport Chek · FGL Sports · Touché! · CanadaSilverEconometrics optimisation · TalkTalk · m/SIX, The&Partnership · United Kingdom + Attribution AwardFrom Couch to Coast · Central Coast · Tourism Central Coast · AFFINITY · AustraliaUber Legends · Uber · FP7 McCann Dubai · Jordan, United Arab EmiratesBronzeReal-Time Infection Alert System · Lifebuoy · Unilever · Mindshare Vietnam · VietnamData-proofed social campaign · Booking.com · Mindshare · ChinaUsing Google Search ads as a real-time news portal · ZEE5 · ZEE Entertainment Enterprise Ltd · Publicis Media, Equinox Digital · IndiaMore information on this year's WARC Media Awards - Best Use of Data winners is available here.
