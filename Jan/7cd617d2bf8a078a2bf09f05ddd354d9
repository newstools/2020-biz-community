At FCB in particular, being part of the team that created a short film for South African Tourism was a highlight. Winning an award for Best Foreign Film for that particular piece was truly special. However, the thing I am most proud of is watching some brilliant young talent move up in their careers to positions and opportunities that they deserve. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about your judging experience and how this has equipped you for your role on the jury panel.

If the piece is unexpected, evocative and contagious, it’s usually a winner.Ultimately, the work that makes me jealous, the work that makes me think, “I wish I had done that,” is usually a winning entry..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to? The work. It’s all about the work. The great entries inspire me to do better, be better and celebrate the best. New York is my favourite city in the world. To judge work that inspires me in a city that inspires me is a dream come true. This year I will dream again. pic.twitter.com/W37Ch7M108— AHMED TILLY (@AhmedTilly) January 19, 2020Visit FCB.co.za to find out more on Tilly and follow him @AhmedTilly on Twitter.
