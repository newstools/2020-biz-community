Netflix SA service has grown by over 500%, with shows that speak to South African audiences since its’ launch in January 2016 and is estimated to grow to more than 337 thousand subscribers in South Africa in 2020 (Statista, 2019) The rapid growth of Video on Demand services such as Netflix vs DSTV Premium is evident. Viewers want to be entertained in time and places convenient for them.The Competition Commission has mandated that South Africa’s two Big Mobile Operators Vodacom and MTN, reach an agreement with it on “substantial and immediate reductions” on data tariffs by February 2020 — especially prepaid monthly data bundles — or face prosecution. Vodacom and MTN to reduce data costs by 30% to 50%. Coupled with this there is increasing availability of Fibre in densely populated areas like Soweto and Katlehong, Giving rise to the access of fibre in townships. This means that online video consumption and the VOD trends that we see will increase at a faster pace in the main market and consumption patterns will change. What does the African agency of the future look like? It’s the one telling the most compelling African stories, in the spaces and places where consumers want them. Whether that’s on the small screen or whether that is on their laptops at work – it’s the homegrown content that they are searching out and resonating with.And the type of content that is working is blurring the lines between advertising, publishing and media. The three are becoming one. Why? With great content, you don’t need large media spend because the nature of the content would be of a sharable nature.

Or rather, they should be. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517595-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Lisa MacLeod, head of digital, Tiso Blackstar Group." width="120" height="120">#DigitalJourneys: The power of contentTwenty years ago, there was no Wi-Fi, Google, social media, podcasts, Kindle and Netflix.

To truly embrace the principles of content marketing, brands need to realise that consumers are not sitting around waiting for their branded content. This is especially true in the digital realm, where brands need to realise that they are encroaching on the personal space of the consumer. With that, comes the responsibility of supplying consumers with content that has tangible and real-world value, first and foremost. The brand’s agenda needs to be put on the back burner if they want to have any shot at building authentic brand affinity amongst the mass market. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/514188-120x120.jpg?3" alt="Image credit: Nathan Dumlao on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Mass market challenges need mass-market peopleWhat do clients want the most from us?
