I can think of no better platform for the world’s best radio than an organisation like NAB, which has celebrating “bringing content to life” for close to a century. This is a bold new chapter for NYF and I simply can’t wait to hear this year’s entries.” – Mark Travis, associate director of media, production, New York Philharmonic and NYF Radio Awards Advisory Board In honour of this momentous invention, New York Festivals Radio Awards will celebrate 100 years of Radio while bringing together global storytellers from both the Radio and TV & Film industry on the same stage.“100 years ago, in 1920, radio linked a formerly insular public and created a common ground for understanding, for sharing of culture, for education and entertainment. Today, more than ever, through podcasts and global distribution, broadcasters touch hearts and minds around the world and around the clock,” said Lou Simon, radio producer for SiriusXM Radio and NYF Radio Awards Grand Jury. “It’s wonderful to gather and celebrate some of our shining examples of freedom and integrity.”Radio storytelling begins with a distinctive voice and ends with a captivating narrative that engages listeners on a broad range of topics.“The NYF is right in sync with the most important movement taking place in media today – a revival of enthusiasm for the art of storytelling. Storytelling has been the foundation of oral communications from the dawn of language to the present-day explosion in technology. The idea of outstanding storytellers from around the planet gathering in Las Vegas to celebrate this most evolved element of human connectivity is deeply gratifying to those of us who love the spoken word and remain in awe of its power.” – Michael Harrison, publisher, Talkers and NYF Radio Awards Advisory Board New York Festivals Radio Awards robust roster of categories celebrates the innovative storytelling from content creators from 40 countries around the world.

NYF honours the importance of powerful storytelling on a global level. I am proud to be a part of this organisation.” – Valerie Geller, president, Geller International Media and NYF Radio Awards Advisory Board The 2020 Storyteller’s gala celebrates the tenth year of NYF’s strategic partnership with the annual NAB Show.
