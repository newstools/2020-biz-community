In 2017 she moved into the midday slot with the B-Side with Bridget Masinga, which has grown into a favourable lifestyle show exploring the latest arts and culture trends while tapping into the zeitgeist of our times. “With an extensive career in radio, Bridget has contributed largely to our vision as a station with a show that has grown to truly epitomise the Afropolitan lifestyle. We wish her the best in all her future endeavours which will be nothing short of fantastic," said Neil Johnson, Kaya FM’s Chief Content Officer. Kaya FM will replace the B-Side with a new show starting in March 2020. The show’s host will be announced soon.
