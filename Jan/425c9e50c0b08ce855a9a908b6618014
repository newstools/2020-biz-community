Plug-and-play video simply won’t drive the same results as it did and brands will need to make informed decisions about when to use video, what content to include in the video and who is being reached at which point in the sales cycle in order to maintain results. More and more clients will be seeking out specialist services to extract and interpret important analytics on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook to determine what works and what doesn’t. Using data doesn’t diminish the creative, but rather provides focus in your audience segmentation and personalisation of video. Without data-backed decisions, video marketing becomes subjective and video gets produced based on what looks the most beautiful and not on which performs the best.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475116-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Danilo Acquisto CEO of Special Effects Media SA." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: The value of micro-influencers in marketing campaignsAs we move into 2019, it's becoming clear that using micro-influencers is becoming very valuable - perhaps more than using macro-influencers who have a very large audience reach. Here's why...By Danilo Acquisto 29 Jan 2019In terms of influencer marketing, with shrinking marketing spend, advertisers are turning their attention away from mass media and focusing more on results-driven influencer campaigns, which are led by the data of who follows the creators, the quality of their conversion and their engagement. Only marketers who have access to analytics will have the potential to drive conversion and measure accurate results. This follows the trend in 2019 of working with micro and nano influencers to drive true conversion, as in SA audiences of smaller than 10,000 on Instagram almost drive twice the engagement. As a side note, in 2020 the IAB will also have its first year of the Digital Influencer Committee working through a roadmap for standards, which will encourage the marketers to spend more.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522688.jpg" alt="The IAB SA Digital Influencer Marketing Committee is announced" width="120" height="120">The IAB SA Digital Influencer Marketing Committee is announcedThe IAB SA is proud to announce the selected committee members for the much anticipated IAB SA Digital Influencer Committee, under the leadership of IAB SA member and R-Squared Digital CEO and Founder, Stephane Rogovsky...Issued by IAB South Africa 22 Oct 2019Long-form is on the riseA bit dramatic but it is interesting to note that in 2017, 80% of videos online were shorter than 5-minutes long, and with attention spans getting shorter and shorter you would expect that trend of shorter videos to increase. It won’t. SimilarWeb in 2019 reported that of the 78 million monthly visits to YouTube in South Africa, the average time spent per visit was just over 32 minutes – double that of any of the other most popular sites. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1805/439458-120x120.jpg?2" alt="TV celebrity and CEO of Special Effects Media, Danilo Acquisto. © ." width="120" height="120">Danilo Acquisto on the online video revolution (Part 1)Everyone is creating online video nowadays and by doing this, bypassing traditional channels, serving hundreds of millions of people their lively forms of content.

Video is incredibly hardworking and because the perception that video needs to be ridiculously expensive is starting to fade, marketers will start to think about how to use various formats of video at various stages of the marketing journey and across platforms with cross-promotion, personalisation per platform, user-generated content and helpful how-to video content. Marketers are going to start to look at how to tweak video assets to suit various phases of marketing and the various platforms to run longer campaigns with solidified consistent messaging.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490512-120x120.jpg?3" alt="The value of specialist services in your marketing mix" width="120" height="120">The value of specialist services in your marketing mixWhile a multi-service agency does make for a smooth process, there is a strong case for opting for specialist agencies in the marketing mix...By Danilo Acquisto 3 Apr 2019Video podcastsIn 2019 we saw a rise in brands investing in podcast series. It is an audio and visual content-generating exercise that allows conversations to begin and content to be used over a longer period of time. This trend of filmed podcasts will only increase in 2020.Increased video advertisingBecause of the insurgence of video, standing out and gaining engaged views on video content is becoming increasingly more difficult and so in 2020, we expect to see an increase in the video advertising and media spend budgets as brands try to drive direct measurable results from campaigns that convert the most consumers.
