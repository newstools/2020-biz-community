PRISM Young Voices was launched in 2017, originally as PRISM Young Judges (PYJ). It is a platform offering mentorship and skills development in partnership with the PRISM Awards and the Public Relations Institute of Southern Africa (PRISA). PRISM Young Voices Founder, and Convenor of the PRISM Awards, Palesa Madumo, says the training that the young judges will receive will be instrumental to their careers and serve as guidance going forward. “Industry experts have a responsibility to mentor young minds who will plan to make a career in public relations and communications. This will give ten top candidates the opportunity to learn from industry experts, receive peer-to-peer training and receive a youth-focused perspective on competing campaigns,” she said. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/535746-625x387.jpg" alt="#PRISMAwards20: Call for young voices" width="625" height="387">Applicants can be students or professionals with at least two years’ experience in the public relations and communication environment, or be actively involved in the industry. One of the ten young judge slots will be awarded to a final-year student entrant studying public relations or communication.  This is an exciting opportunity for a young professional to gain insight into the industry and jumpstart their career. All entrants are required to submit a 500-word motivation on why they should be selected OR submit a minute-long motivation video to info@prismyoungjudges.combRev('brev-82ef5562-24b5-4481-9350-1303f0acf604', '>a/\<moc.segdujgnuoymsirp@ofni>"moc.segdujgnuoymsirp;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
