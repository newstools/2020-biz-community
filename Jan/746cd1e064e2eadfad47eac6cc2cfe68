Following on from Gen Zs are the pre-schooler and kindergarteners of today. And according to McCrindle, there are 2.5 million Gen Alpha’s born around the globe each week.According to a survey carried out by British company Bullguard: The leading cause of Gen Alpha’s early development was technology, including access to digital devices, Facebook and Google. The proliferation of these tools has allowed children to quickly absorb a wealth of knowledge that was unavailable to previous generations.As children are ‘growing older’ younger, this means that the youths’ needs are increasing, and constantly changing in terms of their age-specific requirements – including faster education and larger rates of intellectually stimulating content with which to engage. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/518220-120x120.jpg?3" alt="Photo by Kiana Bosman on Unsplash" width="120" height="120">Say hello to Generation AlphaBracing and gearing our businesses for the onslaught of the future consumer is key to remaining relevant in the media industry and beyond...By Sean Sullivan 26 Sep 2019Outsmart their parents by age 8South Africa, as with most developing countries, has an overwhelmingly youthful population. The Joe Public ‘Generation Fluid’ White Paper states: According to the most recent estimates, it is noteworthy that close to half of the country’s total population (i.e:. a segment totaling around 27 million people) falls within the age bracket of 0-24 years.Statistics SA says around 17 million, or a third of the South African population, are below the age of 14.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/531875.jpg" alt="Statistics via ." width="625" height="453" rel="">Statistics via Stats SA.click to enlargeWith such a large youth population, a key question is to ask is whether we are critically assessing educational formats, methodology, content or studies for the generation whose experience has vastly altered, due to the introduction of the internet and advancing technology.

In the most recent Sunday Times Next Gen Awards, respondents listed God, family and parents as the top things they could not live without in 2019, with social media, internet and television sitting in the 8th, 9th and 10th slots respectively.

It’s a given, it is expected rather than a new exciting development or innovation.  As Gen Alpha engage with tech intuitively, they absorb and consume information and entertainment at a rapid tempo. Simultaneously, they are learning soft skills at an unprecedented rate: problem-solving, multi-tasking and quick thinking.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/531878.png" alt="Infographic via ." width="625" height="443" rel="">Infographic via McCrindle.click to enlargeTo engage with these bright young minds, we will need to offer them an opportunity to be able to seamlessly manoeuver across the digital and the physical worlds.

If our recent bank and taxi strikes are anything to go by, South Africa is not removed from the impact of advancement or replacement. Jobs that will be displaced by new tech in the next decadeA 2019 report by McKinsey & Company, as quoted by Business Tech, states:Against the 4.5 million potential new jobs created, we estimate that these technologies could displace 3.3 million existing jobs by 2030.. It further states that some “jobs in these roles will, therefore, not be completely replaced – but they might decline in number, as fewer people are required to perform the same roles”. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516887.jpg" alt="How edtech and data can set the stage for transformation in the SA education system" width="120" height="120">How edtech and data can set the stage for transformation in the SA education systemEducation is central to the country's long-term development and key to achieving the goals set out in the National Development Plan of eliminating poverty and unemployment.
