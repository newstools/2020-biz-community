"South African designers are full of truly unique ideas, but don’t always have the platform for exposure.  The winning design will be on display 24/7 both locally and globally, which is a great career advancing opportunity for creatives," says Leonie Andereya, Curator at RED.Known for their eccentric and unconventional style, Andereya would like competition participants to know that when it comes to rules for RED design, there aren’t any. "We are not your traditional hotel, so bold design that pushes conventional boundaries is good with us. We are looking for an authentic, daring design style that captures our philosophy of using arts and culture to enhance the world around us. It’s local story-telling that will live on a global platform." <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1706/395505-120x120.jpg" alt="The #REDexperiment: Bringing art to life" width="120" height="120">The #REDexperiment: Bringing art to lifeWinners of the #REDExperiment - a collaboration between Radisson Red and the Youngblood Africa Foundation - were announced at the Youngblood Art Gallery in Bree Street, Cape Town...By Robin Fredericks 6 Jun 2017 The past #REDExperiment design competition called for artwork across takeaway coffee cups and drinks coasters, which have been extensively used throughout the hotel.
