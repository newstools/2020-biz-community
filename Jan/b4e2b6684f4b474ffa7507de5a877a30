The ability to create custom formulas for lipstick and foundation will launch at a later date, said the company.How Perso’s smart skincare system worksWith a patented motorised cartridge system, Perso creates personalised skincare formulas in four steps:1.	Personal skin analysis: The user opens the Perso mobile app and takes a photo with their smartphone camera. Using L'Oréal-owned ModiFace technology, the app uses AI to analyse the user’s overall skin condition – including deep wrinkles, fine lines, the appearance of dark spots, and pore visibility.2.	Environmental assessment: Using Breezometer geo-location data, Perso assesses local environmental conditions that can influence the state of the user’s skin, including weather, temperature, pollen, UV index, and humidity.3.	Product preference: The user then enters their personal skincare concerns into the Perso app, including fine lines, dark spots, pigmentation, pore size, radiance and dullness. The user can also input preferred texture and hydration-level to further customise their unique formula of moisturiser, serum and under-eye cream.4.	Custom formulation and dispensing: This collective data informs the creation of a personalised blend of high-performance skincare, dispensed in a perfectly portioned, single dose at the top of the device for easy, clean application. The technology adjusts for morning and evening application, and the device features a detachable mirrored top so consumers have the option of taking a single or larger dose with them on-the-go.Perso’s hardware features a motor system located at the top of the device that moves and compresses the formula from the cartridges at the base of the machine in an upward motion to the dispensing tray above.With regular use, Perso’s AI platform will be able to assess skin conditions over time, letting the user know what is working and will automatically adapt future formulas based on personal results.The system also features a seamless automatic refill process that ensures its custom, NFC-tagged cartridges are always stocked and ready for daily use. Users can manage shipments from the Perso mobile app.Future makeup offerings will have the capability to incorporate real-time trend information as well as colour-matching technology into its personalised product offerings. Consumers would be able to design a lipstick shade to match their outfit or to opt for a colour that is trending on social media at that moment.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497915-120x120.jpg?2" alt="L'Oréal teams up with Alibaba for AI-based app targeting acne sufferers" width="120" height="120">L'Oréal teams up with Alibaba for AI-based app targeting acne sufferersL'Oréal and Alibaba Group have joined forces to launch an AI-powered mobile app designed to diagnose acne, to be made available on Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao mobile app next month...22 May 2019“Building on our deep scientific heritage and leadership in innovation, L'Oréal is once again leveraging advanced technology to create smart beauty products and services that answer the needs of our consumers and offer them near-limitless personalisation and precision,” said Nicolas Hieronimus, L'Oréal's deputy chief executive officer. “We are committed to making L’Oréal the leader in beauty tech – and Perso is the next step in that exciting journey.”Perso will be launched in partnership with a leading L'Oréal skincare brand in 2021.
