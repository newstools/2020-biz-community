This was a natural progression. Hamiltons in Creative Company has been creating world-class content for years, whether for TV, radio, print or in-store branding, slick content creation was already happening and now it’s just packaged in a different way.

I was ready to embrace change and look at sustaining the business for another 20 years for my young colleagues and succession team and to leave a legacy for my teenager, should he choose to embrace it. I am also obsessed with the digital space and how you can utilise it to build and promote quickly and efficiently, but quality is still key to me. Marketing has been in my blood for over 30 years, so I just can’t stop moving forward..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did you come up with the name, The Yellow Room? The Hamiltons in Creative Company’s corporate colour became yellow by default. When we moved into our office space almost five years ago, we inherited extremely ugly high orange-brown doors, which just had to be changed immediately. We painted all the doors yellow. As a result of this and the brainstorm for the new name of our new division, we decided on The Yellow Room. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Describe the idea/model.
