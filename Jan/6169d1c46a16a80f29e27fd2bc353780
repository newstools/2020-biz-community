Artificial intelligenceArtificial intelligence will become retailers’ go-to technology. Areas of opportunity for retailers to utilise are AI, communication/personalisation, pricing optimisation, inventory, and discovering new ways to engage with consumers. 5. Borrowing from ‘new retail’Western retailers will borrow from ‘new retail’ with data-driven online-to-offline ventures. This will be seen in online retailers offering more physical experiences around calendar events and moves into permanent retail formats, with online data influencing decisions on everything from format to product range and location. 6. Conscious consumptionConsumers will look for environmentally and socially engaged brands and retailers. The conscious consumption trend will continue to expand into new retail sectors, the report states, and will push shoppers toward alternative acquisition models (such as resale and rental). This gradual shift will fuel further collaboration between retailers and brands in search of fresh ideas, endorsement from influencers, and being viewed as responsive to consumers’ concerns. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/534469-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#BizTrends2020: Fashion won't be sustainable until consumers are educated" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2020: Fashion won't be sustainable until consumers are educatedIf you're wondering if sustainable fashion really does exist in South Africa, the answer is yes, but only on a small scale...By Emma Longden 15 Jan 20207.
