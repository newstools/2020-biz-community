It’s a completely free app aimed at helping people buy better. Real people post products and services they have had a good experience with, this then becomes an authentic and reliable way in which people can find what works. In addition, we curate current deals so that the community can easily find them on be.first.  .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}When, how and why did you get started?The idea was born in November 2018. We partnered with a development company called Open Vantage and it took only four months to build the first version of be.first. After having friends and family, as well as an additional group of people, test the app, it was launched in July 2019 to the rest of the country.We took to social media initially to start creating our intention around buying better and to introduce our brand personality to our potential audience. This quickly led us see who our core users were going to be and what the acceptance of the offering would be. We love that most of our growth has been organic which means there is a real need for recommendations from real people, it confirmed that with a growing e-commerce market locally and globally, there has never been a bigger search for authenticity around purchases.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/536087.png" alt="#StartupStory: be.first aims to help you buy better" width="601" height="345">One of our shared goals is to serve our community, so we sought out to create something that we knew would be helpful, something that would be a positive space where people could share what's worked for them. We knew as women that we all at some point in the day ask a colleague, a friend, a family member - where did you buy that shirt, shoes, pram, foundation from… or what are you making for dinner tonight? We knew that women spend way too much time trying to find what works, how to save or where to shop. We knew that there had to be a way to share this information so that it could help more than just that one woman (or man). This is why be.first  was born..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is the core function of be.first?To help people buy better by offering real recommendations from real people as well as supplying our users with tips and tools on where, how and when to shop.

Learning how to be everything in a business is overwhelming, to say the least, we’ve had to adopt a test and learn culture putting us completely out of our comfort zone. Prioritising the ‘right thing to do’ in terms of getting users or perfecting the product. Our culture is to have everything at once which usually robs you of a critical lesson or makes what you’re offering unsustainable, it’s a tricky balance of being perfect or making progress..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What advice would you give to other aspiring entrepreneurs?Figure out your passion, it usually leads you to your purpose. Do the groundwork to test your idea and take calculated risks along the way. Have a good support structure of people that have been through the startup journey. Read anything and everything relevant to your product, industry and from opinion leaders that resonate with you..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What has been your proudest achievement thus far?The very launch of be.first was a proud moment - often people don’t start because they are too focussed on the end goal. We’ve learned to celebrate every milestone regardless of how small it may seem outwardly. We’re not attached to a specific outcome, we’re focussed on creating value through every interaction, this has led to many achievements in our last year because of the bite-size goals we set for ourselves..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What does the future of entrepreneurship look like to you?In our line of work, we’re constantly exposed to mom-and-pop type establishments, in the search for authenticity we believe there will be more and more people looking to create niche products and services that will attract more and more customers. We hope the trend we’re seeing continues as more people look for a better work/life balance..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you think is the importance of startup accelerator/incubator programmes?We love that more companies are starting to see the importance of developing these programmes.
