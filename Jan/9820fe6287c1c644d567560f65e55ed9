The leading search behaviours are information gathering. In South Africa (and with our neighbours to the north) "Near Me" searches are the top trending search behaviour. Our primary search behaviour focuses on information gathering online, to find a real world destination offline.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/536435-625x358.png" alt="What Google's year in search tells us about South African search behaviour" width="625" height="358"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/536436-625x358.png" alt="What Google's year in search tells us about South African search behaviour" width="625" height="358">The key difference between African and first-world-based search, is that the majority of searches happen on mobile, while on the move and have a specific outcome (finding a store) while in the UK/USA the majority of searches are still PC-based and the user is at their desk or at home. The numbers back this up â€“ 85% of South Africans have a smartphone, compared to just 24% who have a laptop or PC. With the exponential growth of "Near Me" search in South Africa, the accuracy and ongoing management of your Google My Business listing has never been more important. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1802/428447.jpg" alt="Google's top 'Near Me' searches 2017 (and what they mean for marketers)" width="120" height="120">Google's top 'Near Me' searches 2017 (and what they mean for marketers)Every year Google releases its list of top searches for the past 12 months.
