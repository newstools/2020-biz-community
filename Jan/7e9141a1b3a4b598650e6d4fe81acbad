Live in-studio action will be captured by six HD cameras, five of which are on robotics and the sixth on a jib. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/534181-625x351.jpg" alt="eNCA goes HD with the biggest in-studio screen on the continent" width="625" height="351">Group Technical GM Rose Rogers said, "Our use of this technologically advanced equipment in the new HD studio is exceptional and will provide a sharp and refreshing feel to all our programs. The semi-circular set shape will allow for an increase in camera angles compared to the previous U-shaped set design. It took us months of work to ensure that the new studios are a perfect fit for the upgraded broadcast quality." Joe Heshu, Group Executive for Corporate Affairs at the MultiChoice Group, said: “In line with our purpose of giving and delighting our viewers with great quality content and entertainment, eNCA’s launch of the high-tech HD studio on our platform is just one more way of ensuring we can play a role in supporting the growth of the local TV industry and creating lasting partnerships with local stakeholders which will guide the success of the industry.”
