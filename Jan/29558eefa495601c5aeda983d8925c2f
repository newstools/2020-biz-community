As a result, OFM is embracing the audio streaming trend with exciting new digital offerings. These are the OFM desktop application and OFM Stasie 2. The OFM desktop application is a desktop app through which listeners can stream OFM anytime of the day. Wherever they find themselves, OFM will be there to keep them company, without them having to navigate the internet. OFM Stasie 2 is an exclusive Afrikaans streaming channel with uninterrupted Afrikaans music – no commercials, no hosts, no news, and no traffic. Nothing to disconnect listeners from their favourite music. In future, OFM is looking to create even more digital offerings on its website to give listeners the opportunity to have access to their favourite music on their terms, including a channel with the best music from the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s – all in a bid to live the philosophy: living the real good life.Says OFM’s Marketing Manager, Lindiwe Mtwentula: “OFM is taking the opportunity of a new decade to rethink its offerings and finding ways to offer the best radio listening experience to our audience, and the most effective marketing partner to our clients.”OFM has big plans for its Welkom studio as well. In the pipeline is a split day-time programme for the Goldfields area with a local Welkom presenter. The show will only be available to listeners in that area and as a result will promote unique content and advertising opportunities for the Goldfields.A brand-new breakfast show and on-air talent completes the exciting opportunities the New Year will bring. The new breakfast show will launch in April and more information about the presenter line-up will follow.
