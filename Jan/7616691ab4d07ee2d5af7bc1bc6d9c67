There is a plethora of beauty bloggers, vloggers and influencers (some good, some not so good). As a result, online retail for cosmetics is growing, as demonstrated by the investment made by various retailers to sell more beauty products online. With no national content authority for all things beauty, TPP saw an opportunity to create a central platform from which to get trustworthy information. BeautySouthAfrica is an online beauty magazine that provides readers with the latest beauty news, tips, trends, expert advice and detailed product reviews. With over 1,000 products (and counting) listed on the website, BeautySouthAfrica aims to be South Africa's number one pre-shop beauty stop.The revamp of the magazine site includes a fresh, clean look which is in line with and reminiscent of the clean lines and glamour of a beauty department store. "We have improved the functionality and redesigned the look and feel to be in line with current digital trends. We have also launched a fully functional mobisite, optimised for any device which we are extremely excited about," says Anien Botha, Beauty Editor for BeautySouthAfrica.
