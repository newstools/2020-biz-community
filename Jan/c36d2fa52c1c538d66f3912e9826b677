I was completing my mini-thesis on local marketing and part of my research was to interview small business owners. I interviewed 10 business owners that were spread across Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban.During my research and findings, I found that many business owners were challenged on the marketing side of their business due to not having the time, skills and knowledge to implement effective marketing strategies on a consistent basis.Our overall aim is to bridge these gaps and to educate, empower and upskill business owners when it comes to their marketing.   .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did you come up with the name? The name Spottmedia was born from the concept of local marketing. The logo indicates the area and market targeted to place marketing on the right spot for the business..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Describe the idea/model. We realised that every business is different when it comes to marketing, so we first assess the current marketing strategy and position of the business. Once assessed, we then create a solution tailored and personalised to the business needs and objectives..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What barriers have you had to overcome to get to this point? Belief and doubting oneself. I think the biggest barrier or challenge you will have to overcome when starting a business or wanting to be an entrepreneur is the battle of the mind. There will be days when it’s tough and the skies are looking grey and dim, but you need to believe in yourself, your idea and your business all whilst working hard, and you will see how the doors of success open.  .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s next? Your vision for the company? We have successfully launched marketing workshops in the year 2019 as part of our objective to educate, empower and upskill owners. We are looking at having many more workshops in the year 2020 that are intimate, specifically tailored to the challenges of business owners.Our vision is to not only help business owners implement effective marketing strategies to build their brand and business, but to make a difference in their lives giving them peace of mind that the marketing aspect of their business is in good hands.    .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any words of advice for others starting out? We were all born with gifts and talents. If we want to live a life that is meaningful, we need to establish what those gifts are and align it to a purpose that adds value and makes a difference in the lives of others. This realisation will become imperative in whatever sphere you find yourself in, whether it is starting a business or working for a company.For more, visit Spottmedia.co.za and/or follow them on Facebook, Instagram and/or LinkedIn.
