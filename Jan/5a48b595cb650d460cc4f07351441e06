<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/533997.jpg" alt="South Africans go plant-based for Veganuary" width="600" height="522">The global campaign was started by UK non-profit organisation Veganuary in 2014, with participation more than doubling each year. Those signing up are driven to do so for a variety of different reasons, whether related to animal welfare, environmental concerns or dietary preferences.The annual event encourages the public to kickstart their year by trialling a plant-based diet for the month – and beyond that if the lifestyle resonates with them.After sign-up on www.veganuary.com/register, participants receive a 31-day email series with information on health, lifestyle, how to shop as a vegan, restaurants, cosmetics, workshops, events, and recipes. This is supplemented with social media content – including a Facebook support group – and a website filled with supportive resources.In 2019, South Africa had the fifth-highest number of signs ups to Veganuary, and Cape Town and Durban both appeared in the top 20 cities – at number 4 and 14 respectively. This generates little surprise, if judged only by the influx of plant-based options on retail shelves and in restaurants in SA’s main cities.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/521488-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#WorldFoodDay: The move to veganism in South Africa" width="120" height="120">#WorldFoodDay: The move to veganism in South AfricaWith World Food Day on 16 October, it's interesting to note that South Africa is one of 25 countries where veganism has seen a sharp increase, with Cape Town being most prominent...16 Oct 2019Awareness and supportAccording to Veganuary, the campaign is focused on changing consumer behaviours and attitudes, while providing all the information and practical support required to make the transition to veganism as easy and as enjoyable as possible through the month.
