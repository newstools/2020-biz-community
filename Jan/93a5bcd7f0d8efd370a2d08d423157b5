O’Brien: As Pantone is the global authority on colour and we bring that colour to life every day in so many printed forms… it’s a natural alliance. Pantone is also a great validator for FedEx Office.

O’Brien: Think of all the different avenues businesses can use to tell their story. From traditional marketing collateral (e.g. brochures, business cards and packaging) used daily to tradeshow signage and displays all the way to non-traditional settings, such as pop-ups, offsite summits and PR activations, calling for unique printed elements.Brand visions and stories must be brought to life consistently and accurately every time to help a business foster an identity and build relationships with customers..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How does colour do this? O’Brien: Think about it. Colour is often where first impressions are formed by consumers, which is why it serves as a critical form of communication for businesses. Colour’s power to evoke emotion, create experiences and make a lasting impact can be harnessed to attract and retain customers when brought to life accurately. Conversely, when it’s not, a potential customer or even existing one can be confused and turned off, requiring extra time, effort and likely expense to win them back..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the power of colour in business terms. O’Brien: Colour influences several facets of our daily lives, providing a real opportunity for small businesses to reach and engage with their target audiences. From restaurant and hotel décor to fashion runways and boutiques to wedding and party themes, all requiring various printed materials to create the experience, including invitations, seasonal menus, calendars, tent cards, event signage and product packaging.When a particular colour resonates with consumers on a massive scale, we see a cascading effect where demand reaches multiple industries, calling for companies to incorporate the colour into their business to help capture the attention of their target audiences.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/535619.jpg" alt="Bringing brand visions and stories to life through colour" width="625" height="625">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How is the colour of the year selected? What factors influence this? Pressman: The Pantone ‘Color of the Year’ highlights the relationship between trends in colour and what is taking place in our global culture at a moment in time. To arrive at the selection each year, Pantone’s colour experts at the Pantone Colour Institute comb the world looking for new colour influences. This can include the entertainment industry and films in production, travelling art collections and new artists, fashion, all areas of design, popular travel destinations, as well as new lifestyles, playstyles, and socio-economic conditions. Influences may also stem from new technologies, materials, textures and effects that impact colour, relevant social media platforms and even upcoming sporting events that capture worldwide attention..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s in it for businesses?
