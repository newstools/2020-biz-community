It is a natural change, after 20 years as chairman, to hand over to Karl-Johan, who has been CEO for more than 10 years. I will continue to be a committed owner, just as today, but from a different position," said Stefan Persson. The Swedish fashion giant reported its first rise in annual profit since 2015, with strong fourth-quarter profit growth."... The timing is favourable for making this change now since we have gradually improved profits and have a strong position with many well-established brands, millions of customers worldwide and good financial strength. We have moved from one brand to become a multi-brand company with today nine brands. "In recent years we have made substantial and necessary investments in our joint group infrastructure – mostly in logistics, tech, data and AI – investments that now are starting to pay off in terms of increased customer satisfaction, sales and profits,“ Stefan added.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/534228-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Woolworths appoints Roy Bagattini as new group CEO" width="120" height="120">Woolworths appoints Roy Bagattini as new group CEOWoolworths Holdings Limited has announced that Roy Bagattini will succeed Ian Moir as group CEO, effective from 17 February 2020...14 Jan 2020Company veteranHelmersson's new position as H&M CEO came on to effect on Thursday.
