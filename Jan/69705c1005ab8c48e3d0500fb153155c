A new vision of Africa 2020BizTrendsLIVE!2020 is where a new vision for Africa becomes reality. Eight speakers, a 360 perspective, from London to Lagos, Senegal to sub-Saharan Africa, on how African trends are shaping the world and being seen by the world.2. A new borderless AfricaOn the threshold of an Africa open for business, former chief negotiator for the Africa Free Trade Agreement and global consultant, Wamkele Mene will outline benefits and opportunities under his topic Borderless - AfCFTA and the Future of African Trade.3. New African disruptionFrom Cote d’Ivoire for the event, we welcome MD Kantar Francophone Africa & Ghana, Ndeye Diagne to put her spin on what trends brands and marketers should they be aware of to #WininAfrica. Disruption, she predicts, has come about via a new “cultural emancipation and (r)evolution”, and what she terms an “irreversible explosion of African creativity across arts, literature, fashion, beauty, home design, tech and African culture(s) that will sculpt new, solid growth paths for the continent.”4. New leverage and influenceIn South Africa, it’s already happening with class acts such as Zozi Tunzi, Sho Madjozi, the Ndlovu Youth Choir, benchmarking a new cultural ethos. Lagos-London-based, Founder of Advertising Week African Tosin Lanipekun, will give an insiders-outsiders perspective, entitled The Future is African, on the global conversations turning towards Africa, especially in the lucrative areas of film, culture and entertainment.5. New economic modelsBronwyn Williams can wring a trend out of nothing, in this case literally. BizTrendsLIVE!2020 will see her tap into the new “virtuality” entitled Unreal Estate: The Future of Finding and creating Value, to illustrate how top companies hold value in data, bits and bytes rather than tangible assets and where the trends towards increasingly dematerialised value exchanges and currency models are headed.6. New African narrativesAlso on the programme, CEO Publicis Groupe Africa, Odette van der Haar explains which trends to track in making “the impossible possible”!
