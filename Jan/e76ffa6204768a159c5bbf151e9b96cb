The advent of 5G and the growth in video consumption will lead to the creation of more visual content that customers can utilise and easily share. There will be more investment in collaborating with content creators whose messaging can be easily linked with certain brands without a major change in narrative.Short-form brand video adsNew entrant to the banking industry, and challenger brand (in its own right), TymeBank, had one of the most focused social media adverting strategies in 2019; where the brand displayed its card in short-form video format. These GIFs flooded timelines, mine and my immediate circle, resulting in improved brand recognition among social media users in a crowded marketplace. Their smart tactics from artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning to the intelligent use of big data saw them surpassing the 600k customer mark in less than a year. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1607/349987-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: ©" width="120" height="120">The declining attention span of social media users and how to engage themAs marketers search for innovative ways to engage audiences, it's important to recognise that the attention span of online audiences is quickly declining...By Julia Rhodes 6 Jul 2016This short-form, snackable, video content strategy will continue to grow as more brands see value in breaking down their messaging to take advantage of increasingly fast-paced timelines in a hyper-competitive attention economy. Video is also one of the most competitive spaces among social media platforms with each trying to out-manoeuvre the other, which creates a gap for brands who understand their customers’ consumption patterns and interests.Increase in branded video content and collaborationResearchers predict that internet advertising will account for 22.7% of the total ad market with a value of over $700m by 2022. The growth of 5G, increased use of Stories across social media and the spread of video content will lead to more brands creating original video content and collaborating with video content creators. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477388-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The story behind social media Stories" width="120" height="120">The story behind social media StoriesStories enable social media users to share short, fun, and cool pictures and videos of them with their social media friends and followers, with the video disappearing automatically after 24 hours. This new trend bottom lines the importance of visual content on social media...By Rilind Elezaj 11 Jan 2019Unlike written content, video is more engaging and ensures that people interact with content longer than other mediums across digital platforms. As more brands realise the need to create current, shareable and continually useful content, we will see more quality videos. Some of these will be on the brand’s platforms which – for brands themselves – reduces some of the relative noise they compete with across social media.With some content creators already working on quality video content, it will be easier for brands to plug into that rather than starting from scratch. Specialist content creators, from video to podcasts, will find it easier to collaborate instead of creating content for a brand outside of their existing portfolio and niche.Black Twitter and other niche communitiesSouth African brands have begun asking questions about niche communities and some have been successful in engaging with Black Twitter, which is largely characterised by political content. With the maturity of social media in South Africa, especially on Twitter, there is also growth among niche communities that develop around multiple interests. Smart brands, armed with digital data, will craft their messaging around specific communities with the aim of better targeting. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475740-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BizTrends2019: Social brands get even smarter with insightful strategy" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: Social brands get even smarter with insightful strategySome of the smartest brands will take advantage of growing trends to reach out to customers and interact more effectively with their audiences...By Mongezi Mtati 11 Jan 2019Year of the micro-influencer (again)Zara’s #DearSouthAfrica campaign was one of 2019’s most-followed trends that had micro-influencers at the centre of it, which talks to how brands are now beginning to adopt a different strategy compared to the celebrity-influencer format. Micro-influencers whose content is focused around specific interests will be included in more campaigns, as brands and their industry peers realise the increased value in this ever-growing space.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517394-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social media" width="120" height="120">Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social mediaAs South Africans got ready to start online shopping at Zara, Meltwater tracked the #DearSouthAfrica hashtag this week, as well as social media mentions around the campaign...19 Sep 2019Some micro-influencers create content around things they are passionate about, instead of messaging that a brand is interested in pushing. This is how micro-influencers remain unique and the reason why brands in 2020 will include them in their strategies instead of bigger names. There is a growing trend towards enabling content creators and communities to build on their existing efforts in collaboration with brands, instead of the brand taking over completely. Smart communicators who will win over audiences across digital in 2020 are the ones that will be seen as enablers, as catalysts for the people they collaborate with and as brands that understand the communities they engage with.
