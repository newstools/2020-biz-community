What did attendees experience?Karolak: The name is related to the ratio of men to women in the industry, particularly at the senior level.There’s historically been a much higher ratio of men in advertising leadership positions, and The One Club wants to play a role in advancing gender equality to change — or right — that ratio more towards 50-50.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505325-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Spotlight on the 5050 by 2020 initiative and Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka's insights at the Women Deliver conference." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Are we on track for 50/50 by 2020?With gender equality more under the spotlight last year than ever before, many in the marketing and entertainment industry pledged '50/50 by 2020'.

Swanepoel: Last year, The One Club for Creativity sent a survey to more than 300 industry women within our community, in the hope of learning their most pressing concerns as it relates to their creative careers.What we received was a truly eye-opening collection of passionate responses from women still fighting to be seen as equals, in an industry caught somewhere between offering lip service to equality issues and making actual, concrete strides.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1805/439624-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Kevin Swanepoel, CEO of The One Club for Creativity." width="120" height="120">#OneShow2018: Better representation across the boardAs The One Club for Creativity's Creative Week 2018 gets underway, I sit down with CEO Kevin Swanepoel for a catch-up on their developments over the past year...By Ann Nurock 8 May 2018Issues brought to light in the survey responses included receiving equal pay, being overlooked for leadership roles, navigating a sexist culture, fighting bias, returning after maternity leave, attaining the ever-elusive work-life balance, mentoring, nurturing, and retaining talent, and being heard.We realised the only way these issues could be confronted was to address the top of the power structure. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528508-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Right The Ratio Summit launched by The One Club" width="120" height="120">Right The Ratio Summit launched by The One ClubThe One Club launches Right The Ratio Summit addressing gender equality...26 Nov 2019And so Right The Ratio was born, with a mission to bring together industry executives and decision-makers — those in a position to not just advocate for, but to implement change. These women and men will share ideas, insights, real-world experiences and solutions to help our agencies and companies create a gender-balanced industry infused with dignity and empowerment. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495586-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#OneShow2019: Tackling diversity, ageism and paying for creative ideas" width="120" height="120">#OneShow2019: Tackling diversity, ageism and paying for creative ideasAnn Nurock interviews Kevin Swanepoel, CEO of The One Club at the One Show in New York to find out what the non-profit organisation has been up to over the last year...By Ann Nurock 7 May 2019Karolak: The One Club welcomes open and honest conversation among all in attendance. Speakers are not here to preach, but instead to share their learnings and hear from others. We encourage everyone to participate, share their stories and offer their perspectives.  By the end of the summit, we hope everyone returned to their offices with actionable goals to improve their workplaces for all..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Love that. Are we at risk of taking things too far in the opposite direction, with all-female panels, instead of aiming for a balance? Karolak: Balance is indeed the goal of Right The Ratio. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1805/442110-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The One Club for Creativity's new chairperson, Susan Credle." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst:  "Diversity and inclusion are the future of creativity" - Susan CredleIt's time to celebrate the fact that The One Club for Creativity has just appointed its first ever female chairperson, Susan Credle.

Lastly, what are the implications of Right the Ratio that would filter through to South Africa? Swanepoel: We believe gender equality is a universal concern, and the issues and potential solutions for agencies are global in nature. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1711/417119-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Kate Desmarais, associate creative director at Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Chicago is originally from South Africa." width="120" height="120">SA expat wins The One Club 3% Movement's Next Creative Leaders awardKate Desmarais, associate creative director at Ogilvy & Mather, Chicago - originally from South Africa - has won The One Club 3% Movement's Next Creative Leaders award...3 Nov 2017Attendees at this first New York event from global agencies could share learnings and ideas internally to offices throughout their network, including those in South Africa.
