Brands that get it right are assured of connecting with the hearts and minds of consumers. In order to survive a rapidly evolving world where disruption is par for the course, advertising and branding agencies need to be ensuring they add visible and concrete value to their client’s businesses. To achieve this, they need to consciously strive to work meaning into the brands in their care.Essentially, it’s about tapping into what Austrian neurologist, psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Victor Frankl called the primary motivation of all human beings: to search for meaning in life. Without some kind of sincere and authentic meaning in place, brands will find it very hard to develop any degree of affinity with consumers.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505895-120x120.jpg?3" alt="Nathan Reddy, chief creative officer and founder at Grid Worldwide and Pete Khoury, chief creative officer at TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris and chairperson of the Creative Circle South Africa.

In the process, it raises a number of critical questions: Are the brand’s values aligned with its actions?;Does its positioning and proposition connect on a level beyond its functional positioning?; Does it have the power – and appeal – to attract?; Is there a sympathetic resonance between the brand world and the consumers’ emotional world and how can you build on that resonance?; and, finallyIs there overall positive brand health and brand dysfunction?  What also needs to be taken into consideration is the fact that meaning is in the eye of beholder. As a result, the custodians of brands need to be cognisant of the inherent subjectivity of meaning. Despite shared values, symbols can mean different things to different people. To ensure that meaning is interpreted in the way it’s intended requires an understanding of the context, the cultural subtext and semiotics (the study of signs and symbols). <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1609/359240-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Semiotics: a strategic tool for innovation" width="120" height="120">Semiotics: a strategic tool for innovationSemiotics is the art of deciphering the meaning of any type of signs (verbal, visual or physical) that surround people in a particular culture...By Dora Jurd 9 Sep 2016In addition to understanding the brand’s soul meaning, brand custodians need to understand how the brand lives in the world. To survive – and thrive – in future, it’s imperative that brands play a role in popular culture. It’s essential that every brand has a single-minded and clear view of its proposition. Ideally, this proposition should be grounded in trust and authenticity. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/406901-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nathan Reddy, photographed in line with Grid's brand refresh by Liezl Zwarts of Lamppost." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2017: Hall of Fame inductee Nathan Reddy on Grid's culture refresh disruption and curationIn this off-the-cuff interview, Reddy shares his views on the formidable work coming from the Middle East and why his 23-year-old daughter is his source of inspiration...By Leigh Andrews 20 Aug 2017To achieve this requires interrogating the heart and soul of a brand and its distinctive assets and then ensuring a seamless customer experience of the brand across all touchpoints.
