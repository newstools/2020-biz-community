Staying secure (digital privacy)The progress of digital privacy and transparency is an opportunity for solutions. Online privacy and the protection of personal information has been on the tongues of consumers for years. First-party data and cookies will soon be a thing of the past, meaning it's time to test and learn. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/445711-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Privacy - The new luxury purchase" width="120" height="120">Privacy - The new luxury purchaseIn the wake of the recent Facebook scandal that revealed how Cambridge Analytical had gained improper access to the sensitive, personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users, consumers around the world are waking up to the value of personal privacy...By Bronwyn Williams 20 Jun 2018This browser identification tool makes audience targeting, data trading, measurement, attribution and frequency capping for the open web possible.

Users want to feel connected to the subject matter and to do this, careful consideration needs to be given to a combination of design, placement and environment.3. Slide into the DMs (chat messaging)This is a line of marketing that speaks directly to customers, it is personal and direct. This will continue to grow as it is a direct way of starting a conversation with consumers and it caters to the fact that we are becoming more demanding in that we expect helpful, personal and emphatic interactions with brands. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504723-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Conversational marketing and the use of the chat tool in South Africa" width="120" height="120">Conversational marketing and the use of the chat tool in South AfricaOver the past few months, I have visited countless local websites that are implementing chats as a means to generate their leads.

Let the machines help (AI and machine learning)Artificial intelligence and machine learning in marketing aim to personalise customer service and minimise the need for extensive human intervention by making use of chatbots and task automation. AI offers data-driven insights and allows for the tailoring of the experience for users, as it learns what they like and engage with.

What does it all mean? (analytics)Analytics is growing in prominence, helping to identify strengths and weaknesses, and quantifying efforts and results. Making use of available tools to track not only the success of marketing campaigns but also to track the performance of businesses, is becoming more important.
