What do you love about your industry? Discontinuous change, the need to continually evolve, sometimes quickly and dramatically. There’s always a need to learn and improve what we do in order to stay ahead. I love the unique personalities that make the industry work, from the crazy and colourful creative types to the equally crazy and keen data scientists. Advertising is so diverse, open and grounded in culture that it’s hard to think of a better industry to be a part of.6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. I’m a creature of habit, so it definitely exists for me. I’m up at 5:30am, kick start with coffee, get the kids ready and in the car for school by 6:30am, drive (winter) or cycle (summer) to the office by 8:30am.

What are the tools of your trade? Laptop, Google, Office365 and some really cool strategic and implementation tech that IPG Mediabrands has built over the years.8. Who is getting it right in your industry? I think the smaller, digitally focused agencies are getting it right. The ones that operate in the world that exists between the traditional media and creative agencies.Their speed and agility is making them exceptionally important in a space where high volume, low-cost performance digital and disposable creative exists.9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. The type of talent we employ and how we then invest in educating this talent are the two areas we can really improve on as an industry.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/520181-120x120.jpg?2" alt="King captions this: “Sweats for admin Thursday!”" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...

What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry?You really need to have grit to cut it in this industry. It can chew you up and spit you out pretty quickly if you can’t handle the pressure. There is a section of a poem I love, called ‘Thinking’ by Walter D Wintle that I think defines the approach people should have to crack it in our industry:Life's battles don't always go To the stronger or faster man; But sooner or later the person who wins Is the one who thinks he can.Simple as that.
