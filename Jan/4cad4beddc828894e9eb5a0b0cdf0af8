The branch allows Scan Display to offer exhibition products and technology that are new to the Rwandan market. One such new product which Scan Display Rwanda provided for ICASA 2019 is the Tension Fabric System (TFS) – printed graphics which are stretched into frames to create walls and exhibition structures. It is a flexible system as the frames create modular structures. The decision to use TFS proved a wise one, as it allowed for last-minute modifications, says Alastair Stead, Scan Display’s African Business Development Manager. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/535856-625x469.jpg" alt="Scan Display Rwanda delivers seamless solution at AIDS conference" width="625" height="469">“A number of our clients also commented about how cost-effective it was to use our TFS package solution, compared to bringing in items from the UK, Canada or the US,” adds Stead. Again, this is because of the compact, lightweight nature of TFS, which means its transport-related costs are minimal. The system’s fabric graphics pack small and are lightweight, making them easy to transport. They can also be washed and re-used. Freight delays can sometimes cut into the available build-up time, but because assembling TFS is quick and easy, all the stands can be completed on time. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/535857-625x469.jpg" alt="Scan Display Rwanda delivers seamless solution at AIDS conference" width="625" height="469">Alastair Stead says, “The clients on the ICASA show were thrilled with the quality of their stands and commented on the professional look and feel of the show.” He continues, “Having Tension Fabric System for ICASA 2019 has added a new dimension to the exhibition industry in Rwanda. The ICASA stands looked fantastic and we have had a number of enquires for other events.”  He added that Scan Display Rwanda has TFS stock in Rwanda, having just recently added another 50 3x3 metre fabric booths to the ICASA stock, for future projects.
