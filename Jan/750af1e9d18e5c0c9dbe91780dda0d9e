What else is creativity if not innovation?B2b should not stand for ‘Business to Boring’If B2C advertisers struggle with short-termism and lack of creative risk-taking, then the real frontier to be broken through is in the B2B area. Currently, much B2B plays in the ‘Business to Boring’ space, relying on stock photos and images of glass skyscrapers and cheesy rational headlines.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1606/349465-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Rational versus emotional decision-making (2016-status)" width="120" height="120">Rational versus emotional decision-making (2016-status)Everybody that is interested in the discussion about whether people make rational or emotional decisions - and all marketers are interested in this - should be aware of the background to the discussion...By Erik Du Plessis 5 Jul 2016Is this because we believe that B2B decisions are made purely on rational factors?The simple fact is that humans work in businesses. The very humans we are attempting to win over in the B2B space are driven by emotion as much as anywhere else.  This isn’t “new news” – the Nobel prize winner, Daniel Kahneman, wrote about this in his  must-read book “Thinking, Fast and Slow,” where he describes the two different modes of thinking "System 1: instantaneous, driven by instinct and emotion” and "System 2: slower, driven by deliberation and logic”.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1802/429069-120x120.png?2" alt="The Give Art Life book by Cullinan for client Absa L'Atelier." width="120" height="120">"Financial advertising is far from boring": Cullinan SA on their Midas Award winsWhile the advertising industry is cluttered with award shows, the Midas Awards that recognise the world's best financial advertising are ones to watch as this form of brand messaging is aimed at gaining the rarest kind of consumer trust imaginable.

What happens in the siloesFor businesses that have both consumer and business targets, these experiences and impressions are formed in large part by their exposure to consumer advertising and experiences that embed themselves into their own personal System 1 reservoir. Funnily enough, humans don’t compartmentalise as much as our channel plans do. Of course, we anticipate that our business customers will have seen some of our consumer advertising and activations, but somehow in the siloes, whilst the consumer marketers seem to be pushing for greater creativity based on deep insights (well, the good ones are anyway), it seems acceptable to throw that methodology in the bin and adopt a rational, fact-based approach to talk to business customers. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515019.jpg" alt="#StartupStory: How SoloUnion SA's plugging the senior-level agency brain drain" width="120" height="120">#StartupStory: How SoloUnion SA's plugging the senior-level agency brain drainWhen former SA creative Matthew Bull started the SoloUnion talent collaborative in New York, he quickly realised this was just the model SA needed, so he recruited Rob McLennan and Gillian Rightford to lead this industry game-changer.

There is a lot more of the consumer-facing messaging than the B2B messaging, so it would seem obvious to build on the “consumer brand” rather than to climb back down the benefits ladder to functional product attributes and differentiation.What happens if you are a B2B brand that doesn’t have consumer-facing advertising? Can you be boring and rational then?<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/478807-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Asking the right questions means that you answer the right question" width="120" height="120">Asking the right questions means that you answer the right questionI read an article the other day by Tim Williams, whose wisdom I quote at least three times a week, which suggested that agencies should "Stop Filling Orders and Start Solving Problems"...By Gillian Rightford 29 Jan 2019The answer is “No.” The rise of human to humanThe darlings of advertising effectiveness research, Les Binet and Peter Field, who recently launched their “The Long and the Short of it” report, turned their attention to the question:  Does what works for B2C work for B2B?Here’s what they found: 1. In terms of “the number of very large business effects reported”, brand building (long-term, strategic, creative) is 71% more effective than activations (short term, tactical).2. While “fame” (or mental availability) increases B2C effectiveness by a factor of 4 and maximises profit, it is a whopping 214% more effective than activations in the B2B space.3. Now to the crux of it – does emotion have a place in decision making in B2B vs rational consideration? In the B2C market, only 26% of decisions are made on rational grounds compared the B2B market where only 30% of decisions.4. Differentiation turns out to be the weakest strategy compared to awareness and fame.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/532439.jpg" alt="Via IPA Databank." width="625" height="379" rel="">Via IPA Databank.click to enlarge5.

It’s all very well changing titles from chief marketing officers to chief growth officers, but the growth can’t easily be found without exploring that unexplored continent of creativity.
