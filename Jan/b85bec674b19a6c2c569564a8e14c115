While this was a global launch, South Africa was the country with the second-most social media mentions about ‘#adidasxIvyPark’.

On 9 and 10 January, Beyonce shared teaser images and videos of the anticipated collection on social media, generating buzz on the internet. On 9 January, 143 million people viewed these teasers, while 225 million did on 10 January.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2001/534987.jpg" alt="Social reach vs social volume globally for #adidasxIvyPark" width="600" height="432">Social reach vs social volume globally for #adidasxIvyParkAs celebrities began to share their unboxings from the #adidasxIvyPark collection the following week, the internet was again sent into a frenzy when the likes of Yara Shahidi, Laverne Cox and Reese Witherspoon opened up large press drops containing the entire collection.
