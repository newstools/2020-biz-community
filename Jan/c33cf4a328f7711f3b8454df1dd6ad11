In order to cater for the digital needs of its fans, Panarottis enlisted Techsys Digital to build a brand-new website with features that its customers would love. Techsys Digital project manager Chivonne Groenevelt explains: “Our primary goal in building the website was to put Panarottis customers first, and provide them with a contemporary website that communicates the warmth and family feel of the brand.”<img src="https://www.bizcommunity.com/c/2001/534739-625x416.jpg" alt="Techsys creates new Panarottis website to cater for the whole family" width="625" height="416">The majority of South Africans browse the internet on their phones, meaning the top priority was creating a mobile responsive design to ensure the site looks beautiful across any device type. To achieve this, Techsys began with mobile designs for the site, and aimed for an interface that was as clean and simple as possible to provide a positive browsing experience on smaller screens. Video and GIF integration means that this fresh look and feel comes across with dynamism and vibrancy.  Panarottis Marketing Manager Clare Raney is thrilled with the result, explaining: "We’re excited to say ‘Benvenuto’ to our NEW website which gives us the opportunity to show beautiful imagery of our delicioso meals.”The Panarottis family of customers love performing a range of actions online: from ordering their favourite pizza or pasta, to booking a table for a night out, leaving reviews, and gifting others with vouchers.  With the new website becoming the hub for the Panarottis family, Techsys set out to build a site that could seamlessly cater to all these customer actions. Booking integration software means that customers can book parties and tables online, as well as leave reviews. A nifty store locator tool serves customers with all the information they need to find and contact a store nearby, as well as connect with their local branch on Facebook. To order online, customers can use the new Panarottis site to place their order via Mr D, Uber Eats or Order In. Alternatively, they can use the store locator to filter stores that cater to call-and-collect orders. The Panarottis family loves gifting and sharing, so the new site needed to reflect that. Customers can purchase and send digital vouchers to their friends and family as gifts or treats – all done quickly and easily online. To uplift the lives of groups who may need a dose of Panarottis-style joy, the site features Pizza Bust - an online form that customers can use to nominate a worthy group! A sense of joyfulness carried over into the working relationship of the Panarottis and Techsys teams. As Panarottis Digital Project Manager Annika Du Toit explains, “Working with Techsys we have thoroughly enjoyed their passion for smart, thorough work. The technical ability of both project management and development at Techsys is top shelf. It’s a pleasure to work with them and we look forward to more projects in the future!”<img src="https://www.bizcommunity.com/c/2001/534740-625x150.jpg" alt="Techsys creates new Panarottis website to cater for the whole family" width="625" height="150">View the new Panarottis site here.
