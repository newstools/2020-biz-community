While many retail channels have slowed, eCommerce continues to be a key area of growth.Retail continues to advance digital: global digital retail sales will increase 17% of all B2C sales by 2022, up from 12% today.She said: Two in three consumers now expect personalisation. Before many people shop, they have done their research. Consumers are walking into stores with intent to buy, having done the research, but they also want an experience from retailers.“Artificial intelligence is going to be more powerful than fire or electricity in the future.

Digital is still too small a proportion of marketing efforts. Marketing spend on digital is still under 5%. The rest is above the line. That is shocking given the share of time spent on online platforms vs offline systems. Brands are remapping to understand where their consumers are. It is about transforming organisational mindsets and shifting them.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/457196-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Online spend in SA will hit R45bn in 2018, and consumers are shopping the globe" width="120" height="120">Online spend in SA will hit R45bn in 2018, and consumers are shopping the globeSouth Africans are forecasted to spend over R45 billion online this year, with over 60% making a purchase from an overseas retailer...11 Sep 2018Part of the problem is the legacy success of retailers – they continue to spend where they have had success in the past.
