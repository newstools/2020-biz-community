Their focus is ‘augmented materiality’ or to “bring the material world closer to human interaction and human intention” as she puts it. To Inglessis, augmented reality is a material one; an augmented materiality that seeks to address our need for transformation. A capacity to transform that we are akin to in nature and addicted to in our updatable digital realm, but that we are yet still missing in the ‘static’ architecture of our physical designed environment. “Creating dynamic environments which embody the human presence drives me,” reveals Inglessis in an interview she did with design publication, Interior Design. "The work I do questions how we perceive and interact with our physical environment," she says. With a technical foundation in Engineering science (Oxford University and Imperial College London) and training in art and design (The Royal College of Art and MIT Media Lab) Inglessis and the designers of Studio INI are naturally driven to address technology in its etymological aspect of τέχνη (art /skill) and λογία (reason/science). Their motivation is to design at the forefront of science and engage through art, across the working themes of matter, mind and nature.Connecting the material world directly to human perception"To me, our AM is a material one; it addresses our need for transformation," she said in an interview with Surface Magazine. "In this AM, technologies apply ideas derived from digital design to the physical, material world — whereas the more commonly known augmented reality or virtual reality focuses on simulations. AM abstracts convoluted systems of digital and physical layers down to an entirely material and human-actuated interface. It evolves from digital augmentations to material ones by embedding new dynamic capability in matter itself rather than overlay content on its static. It aims to connect the material world directly to human perception."“If the easier route is to go towards the simulated and the intangible, then in progressing and pushing the physical boundaries our physical design might fall behind,” she muses to theculturetrip.com, thinking about the future of augmented materiality. “I do feel optimistic, but also sceptical. It depends on which trajectory we choose.Ticket sales for the Design Indaba 2020 are officially open.
