If you’re into sharing other thought leader’s content, you need to decide what type of content is going to work for you. This saves you from getting share-happy and just posting random stuff to your page. The same applies to going live too much! Deep dive into your analytics and take a look at when your audience is online the most, then promote and plan your go-lives around these peaks.Create a diverse strategyPush strategies (pushing content to your audience) are great for getting your brand out there, pull strategies (giving away free stuff to create a pull effect) also works wonders! The real magic though is in the tango strategy because it takes two to tango. When you tango with your audience, you’re engaged in conversation and there simply isn’t anything more powerful than having a meaningful conversation with your audience.Build a networkCreate groups around key topics you’d like to discuss and invite people you think will benefit – make sure to outline some key rules of engagement for any page or group you create so that you can govern them effectively. This doesn’t mean kick anyone with a conflicting view out of the tribe – it’s healthy to get different perspectives – it means that you can protect the group from trolls. It’s key to know the difference.
